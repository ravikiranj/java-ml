On our way to the hotel about an hour before checking in, we phoned to make sure they got the note. They said they did see that in the computer and that it was all set. Upon checking in, again we confirmed (as there was no mention of it by the staff at this point) and the gentleman at the front desk said \"Oh, well, there's a note in the computer but it isn't in a place where we would notice it.\" Tired from driving since 6AM, all I really wanted was to wash up and take a nap, but now I would have to delay that to wait for housekeeping to come change my bedding. The room smelled like diesel fumes, but I was so tired I figured I was overreacting. After they changed out my bedding I went into the bathroom to wash my face and hands prior to settling in. The hot water never came. Again I called down to the front desk and two of their engineers came in and turned on the water and let it run for about twenty minutes before it was hot. At least it got hot. The shower curtain rod was about to fall off the wall, there was orange and black mildew hanging out with it's soap scum buddies, and the toilet looked like the inside had never seen bleach ever. The pseudo sleep number bed was either too hard or too soft, the AC was either too hot or too cold, and I was choking on the diesel exhaust smell so badly that after my nap I went to a nearby Target for air freshener.

Beautiful view of the parking lot and plenty of drunk people walking up and down the hallways at all hours (since this is such a classy joint).

The whole Eastern Seaboard got hit by a heat wave, therefore, I can honestly report that the A/C in the hotel is excellent. However, the water in the small swimming pool was freezing cold, i suspect that the staff must have turned off the water heater in view of the heat outdoor. the hotel is very clean even it is merely the Garden Inn. the decor in hotel lobby has a bit of the southern charm as in most of the Disney hotel lobbies in Orlando. I like the idea of having a coffee/tea stand in the lobby where one can freely serve ice cold water with lemon slices which is refreshing in the hot weather; coffee and tea. Cookies are also available from 5pm on. It is a nice touch. We had a great promotional deal form Hotels which offered us $90/night with breakfast included. Unfortunately, the Hotel.com staff was too helpful who indicated that i was overcharged for 5 nights as the system had doubled charged in taxes when i registered online and discovered that i was charged more than 20% taxes, as a result, the Hotels staff indicated that she could adjust the database to indicate there was only one adult staying in the room to offset the double charged tax (i could not understand why she did what she did). Well, this had led to some undesirable consequences which i will describe in the following, so if anyone stumbles into the special that i have had, please beware. As i checked in to the hotel late at night after the 400 mile journey, i was greeted by the receptionist, who indicated to me that the special offered to me must have been a mistake as the buffet breakfast could not have been included in my price. I responded calmly that i had the print out of the Hotels.com that stated that the breakfast was included despite the room charge was $90 (the regular was $160). The receptionist said that the discount code in the Hotels print out was foreign to her, as a result, she recommended me to call Hotels which should then contact Hilton and it would be likely that Hotels would have to pay for our breakfast so they could honour the deal offered to me. All was cool, i contacted the Hotels help line and i was informed by Hotels that the matter was straightened out after 10 minutes of my waiting on the phone. I was instructed to go up to the reception desk to receive my breakfast vouchers. On the following morning, i went up to the front desk to inquire about the vouchers and ensure that there would be no further issue regarding our stay in the hotel. The hotel manager greeted me and indicated that i had a terrific deal with Hilton and that the special code in Hotels print out was indeed a new promotional campaign code, and that the breakfast would and should be included. However, the registration indicated that there was only one person staying in the room, therefore, Hilton would honour the deal by offering us one free breakfast meal despite Hilton realized that we were a party of three. I did not want to make this into a real issue. I expressed my appreciation of prompt service and i left it at that. The truth was that someone in the administration must have made a mistake and the Hilton Garden Inn had to honour the offer, but they would use any means to ensure that they would not have a losing proposition. In view of our stay is definitely very inexpensive, i really did not want to pursue this matter. We enjoyed our stay in Hilton, and we had even extended our stay there by another night. The manager gladly made the same offer to us as the other nights stay which we greatly appreciated. Staying in Hilton in White Marsh was a great choice, for we wanted to visit DC for a few days. All the hotels in the vicinity of DC were charging over $200 a night, therefore, driving a mere distance of an hour or less from White Marsh but saving at least $75-$100 minimum in hotel expenses was a very economical way for us to visit DC but with a very fine hotel accommodation. the buffet breakfast in the hotel could add up if there are multiple persons in a family, but one can easily have excellent croissant, bagels with lox and cream cheese, or above average continental breakfast nearby in Panera (i think this is how you spell it).

We joined their Kimpton Hotel loyalty plan and have been treated like treasured guests ever since. Their stated goal is to be the \"most loved\" hotel company and they have certainly endeared themselves to us. On this trip their dedication to top-notch customer service was evident even before we arrived. We were staying downtown to celebrate my husband's birthday. I had reserved an upgraded room online, but then worried later that it might not be one of their dog-friendly rooms. I called to make certain it was all okay and spoke to a really nice woman (wish I'd gotten her name) who assured me that there are dog-friendly rooms of each kind and that our reservation was all in order. She noted that we are members of the Kimpton In-Touch program and that we were going to be there for a special occasion. She asked if we would like to have a bottle of wine or champagne in the room. I stammered a bit and said that actually we are micro-brewed beer hounds. She said she would see what she could do. So, we arrived downtown around 1pm and thought we'd see if they would let us leave our car there while we went to eat lunch and wait for our room to be ready. We were delighted to find out that our room was already available and we could unload the car. The valet was very sweet to our dog and helped us juggle the luggage, dog, jackets, keys, etc. Inside they have an adorable chalkboard with the names of all the dog guests posted. They also give you a little gift bag with dog treats, a dog toy, and clean-up bags. The lobby has a lot of seating areas, a fireplace, chess set, and complimentary wine around 5ish. I'm not sure what the decorating scheme would be called, but it's warm and comfortable as opposed to a lot of the trendy places with hard surfaces and mod colors. Our room was decorated in a similar fashion to the lobby and included a sofa, lounge chair and desk with desk chair. There was also a bed on the floor for our dog. The bed for the humans was huge and had crisp linens and lots of pillows. The bathroom was a nice size and instead of those little bottles of shampoo and such they had large dispenser bottles in the shower. Probably better for the environment. After dropping our things we went out to explore the city. The hotel is in a great central location and you can leave your car there and walk all over the place. When we came back a couple of hours later there were three bottles of Pike Place Brewery ales chilling in a bucket of ice. There was also a personalized card written to my husband wishing him a happy 56th birthday. It was signed by the Chief Concierge, Jesse Peterson. Too cool! The next day we had a really delicious brunch at the adjoining restaurant, Sazerac. After we returned home I filled out an online questionnaire and gave them high marks for making us feel so special while we were at the hotel. I then received a 'thank you' email from the Director of Operations and it wasn't a form letter! These people are SERIOUS about customer service. I have recently slacked-off on writing reviews because it's time consuming and I feel a little bit like \"why would anyone care what I think\", but when a company puts so much time and effort into making sure I'm happy I'm glad to talk about them to anyone who will listen.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lakewood, Washington", "Title": "\u201cThis might be our favorite Kimpton\u201d", "Author": "tikiville", "ReviewID": "UR125768347", "Content": "We made last minute reservations (day before) for an overnight in Seattle.

Perhaps one of their doggie-guests been chewing on the chair. That's another thing. We didn't realize it was a pet-friendly hotel. I don't know if that's a new thing, but my husband never saw any pets there the first time around. Maybe because it was during the week, and this time we were there on a weekend. I'm fond enough of dogs, but I don't really want them staying in the hotel rooms that I stay in. However, it's my fault for not noticing the pet-friendly tags on their website beforehand. The dogs were well-behaved overall. There were several in the lobby off and on, and we heard barking twice from our room. Lastly, the weekend rate in February was a great deal, we thought.

The location is an easy walk to the water, Pike Place, or shopping. The bed was comfortable and the place had all the equipment you'd expect in a hotel like this. Some of the touches, like the alarm clock, felt very chain-like, reminding me of what every Hilton in the world equips it's rooms with.

You know the kind--they look you up and down, decide you are not worthy, and act like checking you in is a big favor. Normally, I could care less, but we'd just arrived from a long train journey, it was dark and rainy out, we had our discombobulated 7-year-old in tow, and could have used some 'hail fellow well met' at that moment. Publicity boasts about catering to the young uns, but I had to search the website the next day to see what was available for him, and then ask, which put the morning staff in a flutter, because the person who checked us in--I'm looking at you, chilly night check-in guy--should have taken care of it. A much heralded gold fish was brought to our room, which then died. Okay, it happens, it is a living thing, but when we called to have it removed--more 7-year-old discombobulation--we were cheerfully told to put it outside the door, and chirpily asked if we'd like another. I know it's just a fish, but the attitude seemed rather cavalier, especially with a child involved. Yes, they have coffee and tea, but 2 days in a row I had to tell them they'd run out of hot water, breakfast tea, and milk. Don't count on it if you are off to business meetings in the morning as I was. And then there is the nickle and diming that I just can't stand when I'm paying hundreds of dollars for a hotel room--one-ply toilet tissue, big bottles of shampoo and soap bolted to the wall, slippers with a \"if-you-use-these-we'll-charge-you-$15\" tag attached to them.

The rooms are spacious (we had a king suite and a queen) with plenty of places to sit besides just the bed. The beds are comfortable, clean, and the water pressure in the shower is amazing!

Perhaps one of the best moments was for nightly turn down service. When I opened the door, I was greeted with the most genuine smile I've seen in any of my travels.

Every member of the staff made me feel not only like a valued customer but that they genuinely cared about my comfort.

The only complaint is that it was so well liked, the place was packed by 5:30pm. Breakfast was just as good as dinner and reasonably priced (as far as breakfasts go for four star hotels). And the relationship was tested as well: Upon check out, I had learned that I had been charged for a bottle of wine I had not consumed. I figured that it was due to a bottle I had brought in and left out on the table. Simple mistake and simply explained. But I did wonder how this would be dealt with. No problem. I explained that I did not drink the bottle of wine and that they were welcome to run inventory and if it was missing they could put it on my tab. No need.

She had never been and we knew she would love it. I actually went on a hotel discount site and was given this hotel. I had been in the Portland location once and remember it being beautiful and have stayed at other Kimpton hotels and had great experiences. After receiving notice of our reservation I emailed their staff and informed them this trip was for a birthday and requested a room with 2 beds, hopefully towards the top. The assistant manager promptly replied and said that he could accommodate that request but the 2-bed options were lower and didn't have the best views. He then offered to upgrade us for $40 to one of the suites on the top floor. Given that we got such a good deal on the hotel price it was a no-brainer. The suite was excellent with a king bed in the bedroom and a pullout queen sleeper sofa in the living area. Both rooms had their own TV's and there was a curtain that could be drawn to separate the two areas. The room was very clean and well appointed. The bathroom was nice but wasn't as lavish as some other 4-star hotels we've been to. All of the soaps and shampoos though were high-end and there was nothing lacking. That night the hotel staff also left a note in our room with a birthday card for our daughter which included a free in-room movie rental as well as an invitation to call down for a complimentary birthday cake. We called down and they brought up a delicious personal-sized chocolate cake with ice cream and a candle in it. She was very excited! Throughout our 2-night stay the staff continued to be amazing. We spent a lot of our time checking out Seattle attractions but each time we came back we were greeted warmly. There was a wine tasting each night in the lobby and the staff always offered to get my daughter a soft drink from the restaurant. There were bowls of chocolates around that we all enjoyed as well. If I had anything to add to the \"con\" side it would be that the views from this hotel aren't as attractive as some others I've stayed at in Seattle. It's only an 11-story building and there are taller buildings surrounding it. If you're expecting a full city view or one of the water you may be disappointed. We also thought the cost of valet parking was a little much, coming to nearly $40 per night with taxes. I am sure this is on-par with other 4-star hotels but is pretty hard to justify. We opted to valet on Friday night but found street parking on Saturday night since parking is free on Sundays. Overall though, it was a great experience and I would highly recommend staying there.

I booked the rooms for an amazing price ($70/nt) through Priceline. Because of this, I was concerned we may be treated like 2nd class citizens but that was certainly not the case. Prior to arrival, I phoned the front desk and asked about a room upgrade. I expected to be charged for this but to my surprise, the front desk clerk advised me that if I sign up for the hotel's free rewards program, I could get a free room upgrade. So he proceeded to sign me up over the phone and then upgraded our room to a King Suite with jacuzzi tub. It was fabulous! (Thank you Jason!) The room was lovely. The rewards program also included a $10 credit for the \"Raid the Mini Bar\" program and free wireless internet. I had also asked Jason if he could arrange for a birthday note or something to be left in the room for my husband. Well, he did better than that. In our room we found a bottle of sparkling brut wine and a bag of chocolates. Wow! One of my favourite things about the hotel is their HosPETality Program. Amazing! We weren't charged extra to have our dog. She was welcome throughout the hotel except the restaurant so during the free wine hour in the lobby from 5-6pm, I sat sipping my wine with my dog at my side. You are allowed to leave your pet in your room unattended while you shop or dine, providing the pet is well behaved. Just leave a contact number at the front desk in case of problems. You'll be given a little sign to hang on your doorknob alerting staff to the presence of your animal. If you don't feel comfortable with this, the front desk offers pet sitting on a first come-first serve basis. Your pet can be tethered behind the front desk to hang with the staff for up to 5 hours. First hour is free and then only $5/hour. The staff here were wonderful. One day we arrived back at our room to find a dog dish with our dog's name written on it piled high with dog cookies and a stuffed goldfish toy. :o) The goldfish signifies another program of the hotel. If you are lonely during your stay, just ask for a pet goldfish and one will be delivered to your room in a little fish bowl, complete with name tag. The hotel does have an attached restaurant that seems quite funky but we dined there on a Sunday night which had a limited menu so I can't comment on the food. Parking is valet and quite costly at about $38/night. However, I think that's pretty standard for hotels in that area. There is no pool/spa but there is a small, adequate fitness room.

None of these things are a surprise when staying at a Kimpton hotel, and I've stayed at several. What was beyond the exceptional ordinary was the attention given to a Kimpton InTouch Rewards Program issue (the hotel's guest loyalty program) I had with one of their properties I usually stay at in Portland. I sent an email to the Hotel Monaco's manager prior to our stay regarding the previous oversights of the Portland property, inquiring if they might give some attention to the matter. Within twenty minutes I received a reply. WOW! They assured me the problem was being researched so that it wouldn't happen again. They were prompt, responsive and made a service recovery on behalf of the other property when it wasn't even \"their\" issue. Not only that, my beau had garnered this particular reservation via Priceline, so we were already getting a fabulous rate to begin with. When we arrived, there was a bottle of wine, chocolate and a lovely card waiting for us. The valet attendant made our life easier by offering to keep our car parked curbside since we needed to leave soon after our arrival. Our room was upgraded to a suite and and it was fabulous. I'm a longtime hospitality veteran with years in the hotel industry.

But I'm not quite sure what make it \"luxury\" in nature. The rooms are small, but that's to be expected I suppose in a big city.

The bathrooms were small, and very very plain. Nothing close to some of the luxury hotels I've stayed in in the past. But the hotel was very clean, comfortable, and in walking distance of most of the downtown attractions, which was what I was looking for. For the price I got on Hotwire, it was great. For the regular going luxury hotel price, not so much. Now the hospitality. The hotel staff were very nice for the most part, but I had read so many reviews about how they went above and beyond. This was not the case when I visited. I looked like crap when I arrived at the hotel - after delays at the airport, and 2 layovers, I looked about 15 years old, with terrible bed hair. I got to the hotel in the middle of the day, and the two doorman just looked at me. No \"Let me grab the door\" or \"Let me help you with your luggage.\" Just looked at me, grunted a \"hey, good afternoon\" and went back to talking. This ended up being the last time I ever saw a doorman for my entire weekend stay. Got to the front desk, and immediately, the clerk judged either my appearance, or my booking through Hotwire. He mumbled a few things about the hotel, gave me my key, and went back to doing whatever he was doing. A girl at the desk was checking in a different customer, a older, male gentleman, and went through a clear, welcoming explanation of the hotel and amenities, and asked if he was a Klimpton member. He said no, and she explained how he could sign up for free internet. All of which was never even asked, or mentioned to me. I looked back at my clerk and said \"Um, Im a member. how do I access the internet?\" He suddenly became a lot nicer. From then on, I really didn't bother with the hotel staff. The cleaning crew were very nice and helpful however. They helped me out when I couldn't find my toothpaste and the front desk said \"Oh we ran out.\" uh. huh. The last day I needed a taxi, and told the front desk to call one 10mins before I checked out (Seattle is not known for its cab services...so you really have to call in advance). I walked out...no cab. \"Oh we called! He should be here asap\" 10mins later, no cab. I asked the front desk to call again, and they said \"Oh sure, in a bit\" Um. No. I ended up taking a gypsy cab that I hailed myself that cost me 2x as much, but I had a business meeting and I was nearly late.

Second if you are on Twitter/Facebook follow Kimpton, they often have fun contests or secret words to make travel more fun and gets you great deals.

The front desk staff were efficient and friendly, made a great dinner recommendation for a local brew pub. The room Monaco Suite, had a pull-out with TV in living room and a King bed with additional TV in the bed area (seperated by a curtain) - it would have been great to have a refrigerator, I suppose you could ask to have the mini bar emptied.... With the in-touch I was given a Raid the Mini Bar coupon which was good for $10 during my stay. Also I had opted for breakfast for $1 and used that the second day (it was excellent!). Most impressive was that after I returned and they sent the questionaire about my stay, they got back to me regarding my suggestions (thought they needed more electrical access for plug-ins - they said they ordered power strips) -- It seems like the NW Regional director reads all of the reviews and takes an interest in what you say.......... Impressive, not a form letter, but I felt like they listened and reacted. The staff were accomodating, the treasure chest for kids wonderful and our fish Ziggy was a welcome site after two weeks on the road.

We met some friends of ours, who also stayed there in a separate room. The location was good for us and anyone who doesn't have issues with moderate walking -- it was a multi-block walk to Pikes Market, the waterfront, etc. -- you do have up hill walking when you return to the hotel from Pikes Market or the waterfront, though we found some streets to be less steep than others (Union Street, for instance). From the moment we arrived at the hotel we found the staff to be friendly, professional and helpful, and this continued throughout our stay -- the valet, doorman, front desk reps, concierge, housekeeping, etc. Each time we were leaving the hotel, the front desk people would acknowledge us with pleasantries such as \"have a nice day\"; upon our return they would again acknowledge us with \"welcome back\", or something similar. The evening wine event in the lobby was a very nice touch. The overall feel of the hotel was that it was nicely decorated and clean and felt welcoming. The room was also nicely decorated and clean and larger than the average hotel room. There was ample comfortable seating, i.e. two upholstered chairs and a very comfortable desk chair at the large desk. Also, the room had multiple sources of bright lighting -- best lighting of any hotel we've stayed in. There was a nice size flat screen TV, stocked mini-fridge (items for purchase), stocked snack tray (also for purchase), and a room safe as well. Though coffee service is provided in the lobby each morning, there is no coffee service in the room, however, you can request a set-up for your room, if desired. The beds were extremely comfortable, i.e. the mattress, linens, comforter, and pillows. The air conditioner worked great and you are able to control the temp. to your liking from the in-room thermostat. The bathroom, too, was larger than usual. The shower head was to die for and with great water pressure, so you didn't have to spend a longer-than-usual amount of time in the shower trying to shower with a trickle of water, as is the case in many hotels (especially important to those of us with longer, thicker hair). They also had a wall-mounted rack containing full-size pump bottles of shampoo, cream rinse, and liquid bath soap. A hair dryer was also provided. You should know ahead of time, as we did, that many of the rooms face directly towards another high rise, in close proximity, especially if you want a room with two beds versus a king; we were told that there are no two bed rooms not facing the building; besides not having a view or much natural light, this necessitates keeping your curtains closed for privacy -- but, again, at least there's great lighting provided in the room. There are only two things I would add to my wish list for the hotel -- one is to have at least some two-bed rooms that don't face a building and the second is to provide larger than the standard size bath towels. All in all, this was a terrific hotel experience and we will definitely return there on future trips.

The bar/restaurant is great too. The first encounter was when I went to the elevator after checking in. When I was waiting for the elevator, two housekeeping staff were sitting on the couch next to the elevator and the staff door was open with another person talking to them.

The next odd staff encounter happened when a housekeeper followed me to my room and yelled in bad English asking when I'd be leaving for the day. I told her a time. But then when I went to leave before that time, she chased me to say she didn't realize I was checking out. ok .... Lastly, I checked out and told the front desk that I needed to check bags. I was late to my conference. They called the bell services and then I waited and waited right in front of the front desk at a chair. Finally, I asked for an update and they called again. I was right in front of them waiting impatiently with my bags looking at my watch and they couldn't help! The staff need some help with training. Otherwise, this is a top notch hotel.

We concluded our vacation with 2 nights at the Hotel Monaco, a Kimpton hotel in Seattle, Washington. We had a delightful vacation, with great service and food offerd in our two previous locations. We chose to stay at the Monaco because we have stayed at Kimpton hotels on at least three previous trips, in different cities, and enjoyed the experiences. It was an easy choice for us to stay at the Hotel Monaco. We arrived on time and after a fairly long travel day (6 hours of driving from Whistler with a couple of stops en route) and were greeted warmly by the staff - at the curb at check in and by the counter staff when registering. When we inquired about dining alternatives, it was suggested we consider the on-premises restaurant, Sazerac. We quickly visited the restaurant prior to checking in to our rooms, found the menu to be inviting and the restaurant itself to be warm and comfortable. We enjoyed the wine sampling in the lobby during early evening and dinner at the restaurant was so good we decided to return the next day, after spending the day walking and touring the more popular areas of downtown Seattle on foot. Dinner the second evening was just a good as the first night. Importantly, the concierge of the hotel, the wait staff at the restaurant and all associates with whom we interacted at the hotel were simply superb. I am in the \"customer servce business\" myself so I have more than a passing interest in observing quality service delivered by other businesses. The hotels of Kimptom we have previosly visited are consistent...clean, very neat, more of a \"boutique\" sense, generaly reasonably located and fairly priced.

I've never actively searched out a hotel group, but after this stay, I'll go out of my way to stay at a Kimpton Hotel. (And yes, I'm actually embarrassed to go on like a walking advertisement, but our time there was amazing and I feel it's warranted.) The best thing Hotel Monaco has going for it is its service - from the front desk to the valets to the housekeeping. It's refreshing to come into contact with staff who don't come across as disenchanted with the organization. I sheepishly asked about getting a goldfish for our room and, I swear, they were more excited to arrange for one than I was about getting it (special thanks to Shaynee and Hayden). The doormen/valets were exceptional (special thanks to Nick) and always friendly. Housekeeping gave such special care to our room that I felt guilty using anything in the bathroom. The second best thing, is the location. The Monaco is so centrally located that we questioned whether we truly needed a car during our stay there. It's about a 10-minute (lovely) walk to the Market down streets that are interesting in their own right, and about 3 minutes from amazing shopping. The Sazerac is a happening place - great food (you must try the dates) and atmosphere - and you feel lucky to have it available to you downstairs, as opposed to other hotel restaurants that \"will do\" if you're simply too tired to venture out. The fitness room is more than adequate and, while I didn't use the business center, it looked to have everything you would need. And if you have the option of getting a room with a jacuzzi, DO IT - they're spacious and deep. The Hotel only has valet parking which, I'll admit, can add up quickly. I had read online that the Kimpton group strives to be environmentally responsible and therefore offers a discount for those driving hybrids. This came in handy when we had the choice to rent a Prius. Upon check-out, I was informed by the staff that Monaco had a special promotion during the month of August whereby valet/parking was complimentary for those driving eco-friendly cars! I wasn't sure whether I was more impressed by the creative promotion or pleased that I'd saved a significant amount of money, but I walked away elated. Prior to arriving, we filled out a Kimpton membership (at no cost), which asks for preferences on everything from room placement to pillow firmness to your choice of daily newspaper. I filled it out, doubtful that it would actually be taken into account; yet, upon arrival, I found that we had indeed been reserved a corner room with firm pillows and the daily Seattle Times. In addition, there was a card in our room welcoming us to the Program and entitling us to $10 worth of mini-bar purchases (from which there were many to choose). I realize that I may be gushing here, but our experience was so wonderful that, even though the hotel is not the cheapest in Seattle, we left feeling like we'd gotten a steal.

I had several choices and decided on Hotel Monaco based on the reviews I read on this web site. It seemed to get consistent positive reviews. Well, we were not disappointed! In fact, we were very happy about our choice!! We had requested an early check-in since we disembarked in the morning. The rooms weren't ready yet, but the front desk girls who were very friendly and plesant told us she will call my cell phone when the rooms are ready. They happily stored away our luggages so we could go explore the town. They also showed us on the map how to get to certain places. A friend traveling with us was a librarian and the Seattle Central library was on her list of must-see. Image the plesant surprise when she found out the library was just across the street from the hotel! A couple of hours later, they called us to let us know our rooms were ready. I can't say enough about the front desk girls' plesant and courteous attitude - it just made us feel very welcome. The rooms were beautifully and tastefully decorated. And they were spacious!! This was important as we had tons of luggage from our week-long cruise. The rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable. I liked the little gift shop that's at the end of the hotel. The next morning, we were plesantly surprised by the complementary Starbucks coffee, ice coffee, and banana cakes. Those cakes were so good!! They went perfect well with the coffee. Hmm...

I love Kimpton properties. I tried staying at another non-Kimpton property and I regretted it to the point where I canceled my second night and booked at the Hotel Monaco. So, I was coming in to town from out of the country and I arrived late... probably around 10:15 or so. I was tired, frustrated, and just wanted food and a bed. The front desk clerk was so nice and kind to me; it made the difference. I had a room on the 11th floor, which I assume is because I'm a Kimpton In Touch member. I loved it! I love being on high floors. When I got in to the room, it was warm, cozy, and everything that I love. The bed was incredible and the bathroom was large and clean. I have a thing for bathrooms. Instead of dining downstairs, I decided to hop in the shower and order room service. I ordered a turkey bacon pannini at 10:45 and was told it would be about 25 minutes. I waited and waited, and finally I called at 11:45. Apparently my order got missed. They were quick to correct it and I had my sandwich by midnight. They did not charge me and they even gave me an adorable bag of chocolates. I appreciated their apology and effort to rectify the situation; I was more than happy, even if it was delayed. The only thing is, they still didn't get the sandwich correct; there was no bacon on the one that was delivered to me, which is what I was sorta craving. No matter... the sandwich was still delish and really enjoyed it. Just like I have a thing for bathrooms, I also have a thing for robes. The one thing I do not like about Kimpton are the robes. They are a funky animal pattern and the robes always seem kinda worn and faded. I can appreciate Kimpton's effort to be funky, original, and very chic through a simple feature, but there has to be a better option. It's not a big deal, but just sayin'... I love the shampoo, conditioner, and soap at the Hotel Monaco. I don't know who makes it or what the fragrance is, but it smells elegant and earth, organic and exotic, all at the same time. The products were in the shower in a pump, so I couldn't bring any home to research the products. When I like a hotel product, I try to bring the travel size home so I can research where I can get some for myself. Anyone know what products Hotel Monaco uses? Also, as a KIT member, I received a voucher for two free honor bar items. I didn't use the voucher, but it was a nice and appreciated touch. The valets were wonderful when I arrived and when I checked out. And when I got in my car, there was a little package with crackers and juice, tied with a little bow, and a card inside that said, \"We miss you already.\" It made me smile, and I missed them, too! ;-) I cannot wait to stay at my next Kimpton hotel... and I cannot wait to go back to the Hotel Monaco!", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cOne of my favorite hotels.\u201d", "Author": "PattyDMD", "ReviewID": "UR66800358", "Content": "This was my second year staying at The Hotel Monaco Seattle for business.

We decided on Hotel Monaco simply based on location (which is terrific) and pricing. From the moment we walked in, our experience was wonderful. I booked online and received the option of an upgrade which we received at a fantastic price. Let me first state that I am self employed (I own a tattoo studio) and I have found my outward appearance to have a negative impact when I travel, especially in nicer hotels. That was absolutely not our experience with Hotel Monaco... we were treated well and every staff we came across was warm and welcoming. We arrived a few hours prior to check in, our plan was to use the time to grab some lunch. The staff gladly secured our belongings and offered to call us when our room was ready. It was ready much earlier than expected. Both the front staff and porters were wonderful. They were quick to offer a hand and point us in the right direction when asked. The room was fantastic and the housekeeping staff was unusually happy and friendly. On our second night, we ate at the hotel's restaurant. We came in late and it was a busy night. I ordered a vegetarian dish. Soon the restaurant manager politely informed me that they were out of that dish... he had already consulted the chef and had recommendations readily available that met my dietary preferences. It was one of the best meals I'd eaten in a long time. Staff checked in soon after my first bite to make sure I was happy with everything, I couldn't have been happier. Upon checkout, again our train was leaving later than our check out time. Our bags were again securely stored even though we were no longer really staying at the hotel, when we retrieved them, staff offered to call our taxi and assist us until we were on our way back home. Dumb luck brought us to Hotel Monaco, however the next time we are in Seattle, we will be back because our first experience was so good. I would highly recommend them based on location, the accommodations and of course the wonderful people who really cared that we had a great couple of days away. By the way... this is my first review of a hotel like this. Just like most of you, I'm sure.... I am quick to share my negative experiences in hopes of making a small difference for the next patron (after all, this is an opportunity for hotels to learn and improve), however I am happy to be sharing this great experience with you, and I hope you have as wonderful experience as I did!", "Date": "April 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oak Park, IL", "Title": "\u201cWell located hotel was a pleasure\u201d", "Author": "Pentwater--summerjoy", "ReviewID": "UR60283014", "Content": "Hotel is well located a few blocks from waterfront and Pike Street Market.

I have arrived at this building some 1900 times and WOW has it changed. the building used to house switching machinery and operator services for the phone company. I had requested a Monte Carlo suite. It was huge and wonderfully done in what can only be called eclectic. Color scheme was in red and cream with a headboard in sky blue. My room was graced with a sweet flower arrangement of roses and freesia for which I have Jesse the Chef Concierge(I asked if he had a spit personality) to thank. The bed was a bit hard for my bones but the sheets felt great. I had lunch and dinner at the restaurant Sazerac and both meals were wonderful. Lunch was simple with a marvelous spicy, meaty gumbo and an\"heirloom apple\" salad. The salad was dressed with a simple vinigrette and layered on speck a cured ham. Be warned portions were more than ample. Delicious. I had breakfast in my room the next morning. I had been given coupons for a continental breakfast, alas they weren't good for room service. My meal was served by Matthew a genial fellow who graciously comped my coffee to make up. Prices were typical for a room service menu, and I was served quickly. The food was great. I ordered \"Eggs from Hell\" a spicy little number! A word of warning to those in wheelchairs, only two of the accessible rooms have roll in showers where u can reach the towel rack. In my room the towels were placed on a rack mounted on the back wall out of reach for us wheelies. There also wasn't a handheld shower unusual for an accessible suite. The other access issue I encountered was that door returns on my room and on the business center did not meet the pressure standards in the ADA for opening doors. They were difficult to open and in case of the business center assistance is required as the door was too narrow for someone in a chair. I had to have Jesse open the second door so I could enter the center. The hotel is located downtown at Fourth and Spring sts a great location for shopping, theater and eating out.

I got a decent rate of $132/night for a room with a King bed. The hotel is definitely fairly well kept up and the service is friendly. I like the fact that they have wine served in the lobby between 5P-6P, and coffee and tea served between 7A-9A, courtesy of the hotel. However, I found that the lobby gets pretty packed with guests wanting their free coffee/wine on the weekends so there's no place to sit down. Also, one morning they ran out of coffee in the lobby, and we had to wait 15 minutes for them to bring out some more. The hotel's restaurant, Sazerac, is a good restaurant with pretty good drinks. It was convenient being able to get a nice dinner in the hotel. Just be sure to make reservations for dinner, since it can get pretty busy there during Happy Hour on the weeknights. The thing I wasn't so happy about with the hotel are its thin walls. I could hear my neighbors talking and moving about, and could really feel the neighbor's kids jumping on the bed. It makes you wonder if there would be any privacy for a romantic weekend, if you get my drift. Also, the doors on the tv cabinet were askew. Also, I'm not sure why it's so difficult to find a decent workout room in a hotel. I tried out Hotel Monaco's fitness room, and found that the equipment was pretty out-dated. The one treadmill in the room wasn't evening working, and they charged guests if they wanted to hook headsets into the tv monitors attached to the machines. There were no mats to sit and stretch on and the quarters were tight. I'm accustomed to cycling machines, but the resistance of Monaco's cycling machine was really off, and I had a difficult time cycling with just a resistance of 2, which should be really easy. Although the goldfish rentals appear to appeal to some, it seems a little abusive to me. I was uncomfortable with seeing the \"used\" goldfish, left out in front of the rooms, once the guests were done with them. Maybe Hotel Monaco should just set up a nice, well-kept stationary fish tank in the lobby for all to enjoy. I bet the fish would be happier, and isn't that the point of the fish tanks? It's supposed to be for animal lovers. Overall, Hotel Monaco was a comfortable place to stay. I like it's smaller size, compared to the Sheraton and Hyatt down the street. It gives it a more cozy feel, and probably encourages more personal service.

The girl that checked us in was a little standoffish (maybe she is new?)....she stated that since we made our reservations thru Orbitz, she had limited rooms available to us. While we have long known that hotels usually give the least desirable rooms to people who use a discount travel site, we did not feel everyone in the hotel lobby checking in at the same time, needed to have this information. She told us there was a charge for the internet ($10 a day, I think), coffee in the morning, and I think a wine reception in the evening (we are nondrinkers). When we inquired later about how to use the internet, a different receptionist told us to sign up with the Kimpton Rewards program and we would have free internet for our entire stay. It would have been helpful if we were given this info during the checkin process. The rest of our 3 day stay was uneventful with the front/checkin/out desk....and everyone was very nice. Now back to the Porter service.......WOW! we can't say enough good things about these guys....They truly made our stay a wonderful one. Try them instead of the concierge...they truly know the area and won't give u the names of all the \"Top\" spots, but will give u the names (and directions to boot!) of all the BEST places.

Our regular haunts in Seattle were booked, so on a lark, we tried \"Hotwire\" for the first time. We did not know about Hotel Monaco without the benefit of Hotwire, and per the Hotwire instructions I contacted the hotel about room types. Then I read a Tripadviser response from the hotel dated April 7, 2009 that didn't resonate well with us (basically the message I interpreted is that you are hooped if you book Hotel Monaco through Hotwire). Our flights had us arriving early into Seattle and I advised the hotel about the arrival and my partner's condition (made worse by a foot injury a day before our trip). For us, front desk was an exercise in what could not be done; 1) My partner slept in the lobby from about noon to 1445hrs; regular check-in is at 1500hrs, 2) We did not learn about having to request coffee or tea en suite; I learned about it the next AM when I saw another hotel guest in the lobby with coffee mugs, 3) the quirky goldfish element wasn't mentioned at check-in, so I asked twice about it the next day, 4) I asked the same front desk clerk who checked us in to have the burnt out light addressed by the bed...it wasn't. I asked someone else and it was fixed immediately. Another shift supervisor learned about our poor experience and sent up wine, chocolates and a handwritten note as a gesture of service recovery and for that we are thankful. At check-out I advised the same agent who checked us in nothing I asked of her was done, so she blamed the other areas. From doormen to housekeeping to maintenance, everyone else was great. Only check-in was brutal and front desk service was uneven. The rooms are small per building period, made smaller by the bold striping and the lack of natural light as the room faced another building, but extremely clean and the room in a location quiet. We were OK with Aveda toilettries, though dissappointed it wasn't L'Occitane. I suspect the Hotel Monanco views Hotwire bookings as the no frills/budget bookings and not \"found\" bookings (when in fact we paid more than if we booked directy; we just didn't know about the hotel). We are fond of boutique hotels (our favorite is in Palm Springs), but for us this one was a miss. In summary, if you are fortunate enough to discover Hotel Monaco on your own and not through a third party as we did, I expect your experience may be different than ours.

There are some nice little touches like fancy trays of jam & butter to go with your croissant and interesting Asian-style teapots.

In my opinion they DEFINITELY should have asked us if we wanted to pay $30 extra for the \"upgrade\" - it kind of defeated the purpose of the cheap Hotwire rate. Anyway, I'd stay again if I got a good deal, but just be warned about those extra fees... they can add up!", "Date": "March 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cNice place in a good location\u201d", "Author": "lar36", "ReviewID": "UR26873525", "Content": "From the valet parking guy to the lady who checked us out when we departed, all were friendly, personable and professional.

A beautiful hotel just a few blocks from downtown shopping. The first thing I noticed was a Starbucks right next door, as well as Seattles Best Coffee across the street. A good start! The staff was very freindly and although valet parking was $40 a night, these guys went through hoops to make you feel special. Since paying much less then rack, we were ok with paying top dollar parking rates. We brought our daughter, 12, and her freind, 13 on this trip. They had delivered (upon prior request) goldfish in bowls for them to enjoy over the weekend. Nice touch! The rooms are very cozy and beds equally comfortable. Kids loved the flatscreen TV. The next morning we had coffee in room, as well as more from the lobby area. We really enjoyed this service. We walked to Pike Place Sat. am and had breakfast at \"The Crumpet Shop\". Well liked by all. When we went to retrieve our car, the valet opened the door and called my husband by name...nice touch!. I noticed that they have \"kid packs\" available for children. When we went out Saturday night, I asked id they would deliver them to our room. The kids were so excited to get this surprise. Also, the hotel has a wine reception between 5-6pm, which was really nice. I really was expecting less then perfect service having booked on priceline, but I must say, we were blown away by this place.

When I took my printed reservation down to the front desk and showed them that it said things like two TV, a couch, ect, the desk clerk told me \"oh, they mixed two suites into the same description on the Kimpton Website - sorry about that how about a free breakfast\". You got to be kidding me! Even Embassy Suits has a sitting room, bathroom and bedroom unlike what Kimpton calls \"a suite\". I was here for a 5 day stay and this was how they offer to correct false advertising? I send the Kimpton preferred guest website an email asking about the failure to provide a suite as advertised on their website (my reservation description) (also furnished a hard copy of the reservation printout (from their website) to the front desk manager on duty) and did not get any reply or solution. I also send an email after the trip (guest survey) and once again did not get any follow up via email or mail. So I guess that tell you how concerned they are about guest. The staff ranged from indifferent to not helpful. I asked the front desk if their was any good breakfast spots in the neighborhood hood and was told, no only the hotels. Gee I found one of the best breakfast spots in Seattle 1/2 a block away, how convenient that the hotel does not know they exist. We arrived late the first night (11 pm) and had to go inside and run down the bellman who busy chating on his cell phone to get any help with our bags. Prior to my arrival I had emailed the hotel to inform them that it was my 20th Anniversary as my other half is really picky so I wanted to make sure everything was good to go. I got a nice email back saying they would like to deliver a bottle of champagne and some chocolate covered strawberries to our room upon arrival to celebrate. I also told them we needed foam pillows. So upon arrival no champagne or strawberries, no foam pillows and we had a great room with a view of an alley and high rise building -nice! Now the good - you will not find a better housekeeping staff or a cleaner room than this property. We were very impressed that when we left each morning to go out shopping that they made up the room before we got back (even short trips of 2 hours or less). The beds were comfortable. Not so good - the AC-Heat control has a 4 x 4 inch screen that is bring green and will shine directly in your eyes all night.

TV hard to use and iPod sound dock in suite non functioning. ---- I decided to book a Mediterranean Suite for my 3 night weekend stay after my 1st choice (where the rest of my party was) filled up. In comparison to the W, I spent about $45 more per night but had a larger (square footage) room with a great soaking tub (with whirlpool jets) and a nice shower. Before my stay, I had the hotel arrange a car service, the price $53 with tip was reasonable and the driver was waiting for me on arrival. Checkin was easy but the downside was that with a room that was picked for its 2 person jacuzi tub, I found no bath accessories (salts, bubble bath etc...) and didn't get any during the stay. The first night (got in around 12/1a) I checked in and had a voucher for a bottle of champagne (nice gesture) and the fish waiting in my room. First impression is that the room was huge but there was so much open space I felt that the room was almost too big. The TV was far away from the bed so it was a chore to change the channel. The iPod dock was also broken which was disappointing. In the morning on my way out I asked for someone at the desk to check the thermostat out (it said 65F but was around 74, which was about 2 degrees too warm) and try to cover its face for me at night (bright blue light kept me up). When I got back to the room that night, no one had done either. That was the 1st drop by the front desk. I called maintainence and someone came to look at the thermostat but he told me to play around with the settings until I was happy (why have a digital box if it won't work!?!??!?!) I asked for a wakeup call at 10am the next morning, that didn't happen. I called later for a 6pm nap wakeup call.... they forgot that. The 10am wakeup call the next morning, yep, it was forgotten.

We had a Monaco King Room, and they have a program where you can adopt a goldfish for your stay. Our adoptive goldfish was named Belle. Belle was a charmer, very interactive for a fish, and we really missed her upon leaving. Check-In was fast and friendly, and after we had dropped off our bags we went back down and asked some directions from the front desk staff. They were very kind and gave us maps, suggestions, and directions to our specific query. The one little blip in our arrival was that we are Kimpton members and the specific little preferences that were supposed to be on tap for our room, were not in place. However, they later made up for it with a nice little fruit basket and mineral water. It is a beautifully done, elegant, smaller hotel, and I loved the reproduction Minoan frescoes, a la Knossos, in the reception area. There is definitely a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpersonal touch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the Hotel Monaco Seattle. The hotel is placed well, and we were able to walk to some nice downtown shopping areas and to the Pike Place Market, albeit nearly everything was closed by the time we made it down there. One negative, and it had nothing to do with the Hotel, were the swarms of homeless that approached one asking you to buy a 'paper'. Apparently Seattle deals with its homeless in a very humane manner and gives them identity badges and allows them to sell these newspapers. A unique approach to the problem, but it does get bothersome the fortieth time one is asked to 'buy a paper'. That and the rather seedy looking fellows lounging in a doorway, as we were getting near Pike Market, who were coveting my hub's camera - Seattle is beautiful architecturally so he was taking snaps like mad. However, I gave them my meanest - i.e. if looks could maim, ex-NYCer, ex-Chi-towner, ex-Miami, current LA Hollywood denizen glare and they backed off right quick. So, try not to look like a tourist in downtown Seattle, unless you are ready to thrash someone to a pulp if they try to jump you. Frankly, from my point of view, try not to look like a tourist anywhere! So, other than those two little blips, Seattle was fab, and the Hotel Monaco was AbFab! We had a nice large room, it was oddly shaped, but I do like things like that, and a huge window with a view up toward what I suppose are the hills. If one were of a voyeuristic bent, you could watch the life going on around one down on the street, and across the way in the residential buildings. The bathroom was large and spotless, with nice soft towels and L'Occitane products. There were some free sundries, and also a list of other sundries available for nominal prices. In the mini-bar were lots of choices, and these cute little stuffed goldfish that one can purchase. Yes, I got one and named her Belle, Too. In the closet were robes, camies and boxers in assorted sizes, and an umbrella that one could purchase, on the honour system. All in all, the items in the closet were a little on the pricey side - so I did not partake of any, but we got a good price on our room from my hubs corporate travel agency, so we ended up paying less by almost a c-note that we would have paid if we booked the room ourselves. The normal price of the room was comparable for others of the same class in the same area, but I liked the Monaco better because of the ambiance, the 'Green' feel, and of course, BELLE! Oh, and the bed, and pillows, were EVER so comfortable. I might even consider buying one from the Kimpton website sometime in the future. I had a wonderful sleep. The decor was nice and bright, but it had a modern classical empire sort of vibe, as well. There was free wifi, a definite plus, and I got to see other guests walking their pets, which always makes me happy. Although, it did make me miss my kitties. Also, there is a little shop on the main floor for sodas, emergency things if you need them, and they have souvenirs, too. There is an exercise room downstairs, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to use it. Although, it did look nice and clean. The next morning my hub's niece, who lives in Seattle, met us for breakfast at the hotel restaurant, Sazerac. The food was very tasty, mid-priced, and the staff very attentive. When I asked if the breakfast potatoes had onions in them - I am allergic to onions - they went to check, and then later when I didn't get the turkey sausage I ordered and I enquired about it, they said they had substituted it with ham because the turkey sausage had onion in it - ham had been my second choice. The waitress had remembered, and YES, she got quite a good tip for her attention to detail. Our niece, who had never been to the hotel before, told us that she would be coming back to Sazerac with her friends. The decor of Sazerac was lovely with all these wonderful free form glass fixtures, for which Seattle is famous, on the ceiling. The only possible cons about our hotel experience would be that the three elevators could be a little slow, and that there are only ice machines on a few floors, and of those two were broken. None of these problems were deal-breakers. When we visit Seattle again, and we will be going back, we will be staying at the Monaco again if they are available. It will be our first choice. Next time, I will ask if they have any rooms that one can see DOWN the hill from. I'd like a harbour view the next time. However, I did love the hill view, with all the lights glowing in the night. We LOVED our stay at the Monaco because of the ambiance, the people, the 'Green' feel, and of course, BELLE! We will be back, sometime in the near future, if at all possible", "Date": "June 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced\u201d", "Author": "BearAndPenguin", "ReviewID": "UR16827338", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here the night of our wedding.

The hotel is located in the center of a big busy vibrant city, and I expect to hear a little normal street life noise, but thankfully there was not a noise problem. Besides the very cool gym, I also enjoyed the complimentary yoga equipment in my room with the video fitness workouts on TV. Loved the fun animal print bathrobes and cool toiletries and the offer of their trademark pet goldfish during my stay.

The doormen/valets always with a warm welcome as they opened the doors as guests enter the lobby.

It was all very luxurious except that the bathroom sink was very slow-draining. You have turn-down service, fun colorful bathrobes and the NY Times in the morning. There is a coffee maker but the one in our room had a defect. It said \"pause & pour\" but when I lifted the coffee pot it leaked all over which means the filter basket was missing the mechanism. The service was excellent from the valet to the bellman to the front desk people. You do not park your car in their lot, the only choice you have is to use the valet.

We walked to Pike Place Market and other places in the area. Bring good walking shoes and be prepared for hills. There is an Hour of Indulgence in the lobby from 5 to 6 p.m. but I really feel the word \"indulgence\" should be removed and they should just call it Happy Hour. They had one red wine, one white wine, one type of soda and absolutely nothing to eat. No snack to go with the drinks. I asked a woman who was pouring drinks if there was anything like peanuts -- anything at all and she said \"no, but that sounds like a good idea\". I'm sure they have people ask all the time even though she acted like I was the first person who ever inquired. For such a fancy hotel, I was really surprised and wondered why they used the word \"indulgence\". I have stayed at Inn Suites hotels where they have a happy hour with drinks and popcorn so you would think a Kimpton hotel would have some kind of snack.

Also, the ice machines are located on every other floor starting on the fourth floor. I had a suite on the 3rd floor and although it wasn't a hardship, it wasn't convenient either. The food in the restaurant was excellent quality but overpriced and my waiter seemed tired and/or not interested in making my dining experience a memorable one.

Apparently there was no manager or any kind of supervisor over the weekend and we had to wait until Monday morning. The young man we spoke to said that they would cover the food, adding that the person that changed the sheets said that it was fresh blood, in a very rude tone.

Two people called up saying that \"check out was at 12\" and I had to remind them of the package. I finally packed all my things up and went downstairs to check out. Quickly signed the paper and took off. When on the way, I took a closer look at the room bill. Unfortunately they never covered the food, which they had offered and we were charged for the valet.

Overally, I've been very pleased. Checkin and checkout are easy and I've never had to wait in line. I've stayed in both a suite and the basic king room. The suite is essentially a very large room separated by a curtain. The sitting room has a couch and additional flat screen TV. Unless you're traveling with more than 2 people or want to spend a lot of time in your room, the standard room is more than adequate. Suite bath is pretty much the same as a regular room (they do have suites with jacuzzis that might be more elaborate). Hotel is only 11 floors so don't expect panoramic views. Furnishings are \"funky\" but tasteful. Rooms appear to be in good repair. Robes (with animal print) are standard. Large flat screen TVs with many, many channels are standard. Bathroom amenities (Aveda) are replenished daily. Bathrooms are modern with tile floors and granite counters. I've had mixed room service experiences. Twice, it was fast and food (pizza) was excellent. One morning breakfast was late and cold. The soft-boiled eggs were hard, which is good because they didn't provide a spoon. The attached restaurant is okay, but the one time we tried it service was very slow. Have heard that it's good for lunch/dinner but the menu wasn't that appealing to me so didn't try it. The concierge was helpful but was rarely seen before 9 or after 5. However, the front desk personnel were great. Wake up calls came promptly. There is free wireless and wired interet access as well as a computer in the lobby for those who didn't bring their own. There are some additional nice touches. First, they host a \"wine hour\" from 5-6 each evening. Wine is decent (and free) and they do refill your glass. It's a nice way to unwind and mingle with colleagues or even strangers. They are also very pet friendly -- actually seem to enjoy pets rather than merely \"accepting\" them. For example, this huge dog joined the wine hour and started to wander off into the restaurant. The staff didn't panic -- merely quietly alerted the owner who rectified the situation. The location is good -- walking distance to a lot of things. However, the hotel is on a San-Francisco type hill, so if you walk down to Pike Market, it's a VERY steep walk back up. The one nice thing about this hotel is that it caters to a variety of traveler types. We saw Packers' fans (in town for the NFL game), business people, tourists, etc. A nice mix with nice staff.

It's easy to imagine spending time relaxing in the comfortable, over-stuffed chairs. The restaurant attached to the hotel, Sazerac, is very good.

I struggled up to my third floor suite, which was pretty dark (only one window in the room and that faces a building) and had stained carpet (large reddish stains... possible crime scene?). There was no room service menu and the ethernet cable in the room was broken and didn't work (there is wireless). The fitness center is not acceptable for a hotel in this price range and reputation. It's difficult to get there (only one elevator goes to the lower level and that isn't noted so I had to call for instructions as to how to get to the lower level). Once you find the fitness center, its odd arrangement has to be noted. Cardio equipment faces a mirror wall while the communal television is behind you. If you want to use the small televisions attached to the cardio equipment, you'll have to go back upstairs to the front desk to get headphones. The equipment isn't very impressive and the lone treadmill is \"out of order\". You can find better facilities at a Holiday Inn Express. The in-room spa treatments presented a lot of confusion. Several phone calls were required to confirm treatments and even then, one treatment was cancelled just minutes before its scheduled time. This is a nice service and one of the big benefits Kimpton offers, but the Monaco Seattle isn't handling this service well. Room service staff was great, but food was only so-so. Doesn't compare to other great Kimpton restaurants (the Cypress in Cupertino and the Palomar in San Francisco have excellent restaurants). In-room jacuzzi would have been great, but a ring of grime circled the tub. And once filled with water, a multitude of dirty \"floaters\" were in evidence. This was an OK stay.

The bed was dreamy, the linens divine and the water pressure in the shower was more than adequate. Room service breakfast was on time every morning, very tasty, and the tray was always removed no more than ten minutes after we put it in the hall. We had dinner at the restaurant one evening and were disappointed in the food, but the service was perfect. The Monaco is on Spring and 4th, across from the fabulous modern Library, and there are loads of restaurants within walking distance or a short free bus ride. We were able to take the dog for walks to the federal courthouse two blocks away which has a huge grassy hill and another great view of the library.

I was blown away by the friendly and competent staff at Hotel Monaco. Everyone from the front desk staff to the concierge to the housekeeping staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The only downside of our stay was that our hotel room smelled a bit of ciagrette smoke. I had specifically requested a nonsmoking room. When I called the front desk, they assured us that we were on a nonsmoking floor, but that they'd be happy to move us to another room immedietly if we were not happy. Because we so enjoyed our unique suite, we decided to stay rather than move to a smaller room. We were more irritated by the guests who'd stayed before us and smoked in a nonsmoking room than we were with the hotel, which made efforts to remedy the situation. Following our stay, I received a thoughtful and personal email from one of their staff members apologizing for the occurence and guaranteeing that the problem would be discussed with housekeeping in an effort to more thoroughly clean rooms of smoke in the future. I was extremely impressed with this timely response, especially because I'd never made a formal complaint about the room, I had just mentioned it briefly.

But the mattress is a rock hard standard hotel bed that kept me awake both nights. The furnishings are nice and the colors and patterns fun but the chair had a rip in it and the wall paper was peeling.

Since Friday was a holiday, Clipper put on a noon sailing, which turned into a 11:30 sailing and I got to spend more time in Seattle. After a slow, nice, about 30 minute walk from Clipper terminal to the Warwick, I was greeted by two pleasant and professional young ladies at the front desk and was quickly assigned my room and given my pass card. I already knew that I would be on the smoking (9th) floor, (I am a non smoker but spend a lot of time around smokers) as it was the only one left when I booked. The room was quite spacious, and had a lovely view of the Space Needle. There was a slight smoking odor when I opened the door, but that quickly disappeared. The room was very clean, TV was in a nice cabinet, which was very strong as I bumped into it a few times in the dark. A very large comfortable king size bed, which i got lots of sleep on. A very nice writing desk, which I used quite a bit. A small refrigerator, which kept my pop very cold and a nice coffee maker. In the closet was a small safe, an ironing board and iron. The bathroom had a shower/tub combo, with a regular shower head and a wand shower head. The hotel has ice machines on several different floors, soda/snack machines on the B floor. Also on the B floor is the exercise room containing free weights, modern work out machines, (sorry I don't know the names of the machines), 3.6 foot deep pool/hot tube combo, and a sauna, which I all used, and enjoyed. Major transportation stops are within 4 blocks of the hotel. Public transit is second to none in this city, and I sure did not miss my vehicle for getting around. This hotel may be old, but she is solid. I was in the corner room with two streets outside my windows, and when I went to bed, there was very little noise, and I slept like a baby. My room was warm and comfortable. The ladies at the front desk cheerfully programed my wake up calls for both days and they were right on time. The hotel also has a nice restaurant, which I will review in more detail in the restaurant section.

The last morning I ordered one of their special omelets that comes with mushrooms and cheese and my omelet came without the cheese! That's ridiculous!

Our room was eye level with the parking garage; we asked to be moved - was granted the request but the room was on a lower level and the noise level would have been terrible at night (the view was much better, though), but we opted for 'quiet' instead of 'view' and stayed where we were. Seattle is a beautiful city, but it's hilly and it's filled with a lot of weirdo's and freaks of all ages, and I'm not just talking about the homeless - which there were plenty of them, also. Occupy Seattle was going on when we were there, and they were all tattooed, pierced, weird dressed, dirty/nasty drudge/dred locked, grungy-looking young people, and we have young adult kids ourselves, in addition to other young people in our city, so we KNOW what 'weird' looks like. As soon as we entered downtown Seattle, we saw an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOccupy Seattle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 person sitting in a pretty, flowered/treed area, smoking a cigarette and holding a handmade sign that read: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kill Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and had a skull and bones sign drawn on it.

I was rather surprised, though; that the lobby was so nondescript since the Seattle Warwick is part of a luxury chain, but the staff was very friendly and helpful.

We arrived on Friday morning at the hotel at 10:30am, I was hoping to at least drop my bags off at the hotel as we toured the town, but to my surprise, they actually checked us in our room, it was only 10:30am! I was very pleased with that and a nice way to start off the weekend. I had asked for early check in, but I really didn't expect it that early. The room was acceptable and clean, very much a typical room I would stay in, we weren't here to stay in the room all weekend. Even got a corner room (on 6th floor) that had a view of downtown and of the space needle. Cleaning staff always said \"Hi\" to me when they could have easily ignored me. Even though we could have stayed closer to the more active part of downtown, I didn't want to pay the higher price and had no problem walking the 4 or so blocks to get to some of tourist spots or the public transportation hubs (we did not rent a car). This area of diowntown seemed very quite compared to just a few blocks south, wasn't much activity around or people walking around when we were there, but I always felt safe. I checked out on the morning of the game, but the front desk still allowed me to check in my luggage with them so I didn't have to take it with me to the game. I was vey appreciative of that. Not renting a car probably saved me $200 in car rental and parking fee's, but we did have to walk and take busses/train, which was pretty simple since I had researched it well, but would have been much more difficult if I had not. Hotel is real close to Top Pots Doughnuts too!

We arrived via the airport just before 8am and, of course, our rooms were not available. We left our bags and the *RUDE* concierge (light hair) said he would take them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though he did seem to act like maybe they were covered in mud or something?? We left the hotel and walked directly from 4th street up two easy breezy blocks to 2nd street and got some Starbucks. We spent our entire day walking downtown Seattle \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from the Pike Place Market to the waterfront (ate at the Crab Pot and took a harbor cruise) to the liquor store on 2nd street & Seneca to the harbor steps and back. We called at 12:00 and our room was not ready yet so we just kept walking and enjoying downtown Seattle as we had a tour planned anyway. We finally returned to our room at 4:30pm. We had prepaid and got a fantastic rate on our room. The *RUDE* concierge saw us come in and made himself invisible. The front desk clerk told us our bags would be delivered to our room so we took the elevator up and hoped she was correct. I had just walked in the bathroom when all the bags were delivered (quickly) but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see who delivered them. My husband tipped the guy and we worried no more. We had a beautiful view of the Space Needle, a nice comfy bed, a big & clean bathroom, and everything you could really want for a stay. We had a small couch and we prefer one big chair but it worked-out fine. It was nice and cool out this evening so we opened our balcony and let the breeze blow-in. We took a nap and then walked to Ralph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c literally across the street \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and got some deli sandwiches (good) and soda. Ralph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also sells wine, chips, grocery items, etc but they are quite expensive. We paid $14 for two sandwiches, a yogurt for breakfast the next morning ($3.99 just for that) and a fountain soda. It was worth it for the convenience to the hotel. Ralph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is open until 2am, btw. We slept well, no noise, despite the area. The ice machine was just one floor down, no problem. There is obvious remodeling going on in the hotel because you could see some of it marked off and smell the new paint but it did nothing to dampen our stay. Our wake-up call came on time and we were showered and dressed and out the door by 6:00 am. Hubby checked us out in no time. We had no charges as we had prepaid and not used the Internet or purchased anything. They put a $50 hold on a credit card but released it later. The morning of Sept 20th we had an incredibly friendly concierge (dark hair) who went out of his way to help us get a ride to the Amtrak station to catch the train to Vancouver \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he actually got us a very nice ride to the station for $10 flat.

My wife needed a certain corporate rate for a business trip, she brought the family, we didn't do as much research as we otherwise might for a business-plus-pleasure-bring-the-family trip. First impressions count for a lot, and the Warwick really bit the big one here. I've never stayed anywhere so militant about its check in time, particularly one so slack as 3:00 p.m. We flew in from the east coast and arrived at 11:30 a.m. or so. No room available. We were told to check back in two hours. We came back at 2:15 or so and had to sit until 3:01 to get our room. The front desk staff were not only unconcerned, but barely masked their mild amusement at our inconvenience. The lobby was full of people in the same situation. The lobby was small and beat up, and managed to look like a refugee camp for much of the time we were there. Slow elevators aggravated the conditions. After the abysmal welcome, the mediocre room was rather refreshing. But the plumbing was poor. The faucets mustered barely a trickle, and the tub drain was slow. The TV was a traditional 4:3 job, placed rather low in a console so you can't see it well in the bed, kind of hidden behind your feet. We were on the 5th floor, facing a bus stop, which was hugely noisy. It was as if the room acoustics were tuned to the bus engines. They start running at about 5 a.m. during the week; mercifully later on the weekend. That said. The location is excellent. Convenient to convention center, Pike Place market, waterfront, Seattle Center, and surrounded by worthy restaurants. The bar in the hotel isn't bad. An upscale market across the street gets you all you need (except fresh bread) at nearly any hour. There's a refridgerator in the room. The Cinerama across the street has a cool retro look to it, and there's a view of the Space needle. The street scene is fun to watch. Beyond the few rotten apples at the front desk, the bell and housekeeping staff were friendly and professional. Consistent with the late check-in time, the noon check-out time is rather generous. The pool/whirlpool is fine for a quick dip, and the gym looked O.K., too. We got the sense that the Warwick does a high-volume tourist business associated with the cruise ship terminals not far away. I suppose the hotel is appropriate for that market; a place to crash before embarking on a cruise or making an airport connection with perhaps a few hours to see a bit of Seattle's sights. The Warwick is definitely not a business class hotel, but perhaps it's unfair to hold it to that standard. Whatever the application, there are no doubt much better places to stay in Seattle.

While we reserved over the phone they guy on the line said \"You are aware this is a non view room???\" IF that was a non view room, Im impressed! WE loved looking at the space needle at night. Cool! The room was moderately decorated and very clean. Lots of pillows! Carpets looked brand new. Bathroom was standard and had a kick-butt blowdryer for my long hair. A few hotels near the Warwick were double the price per night and I imagine they were top of the line. This place was great for what we needed it for. The beds were a little soft for my back but the place was spotless and comfy. The noise. Ok, so you are in Seattle in the middle of the city. You will hear sirens, trucks etc. Bring earplugs and you will be just fine. If you are not a light sleeper, the noises are not that bad. If you want complete quiet, go camping in a forest. The location was great. We walked everywhere (with our 7 year old)....the space needle, the market, shopping..... and he never complained that it was \"too far\". The location of the Warwick is great. The restaurant in the hotel was pricey but good for breakfast. There is a funky deli/market across the street where were would get drinks and cool pastries from. We enjoyed the pool. Again, the complaints on here are silly. You want an olympic sized pool in the heart of Seattle? The pool was nice and warm and clean and I could stay in the hot tub while my son swam because they were adjacent. It was a nice place to go unwind after a day of sightseeing. IF you need to do some hard core laps then it would be too small but for a soak and a small swim it is great. The gym was small too but it was being used and the people in it were sweating and getting a work out. We didnt like that we had to pay $27 a day for parking. That, in my opinion, made the hotel more expensive than they told us it would be. Wondering if all hotels charge for parking?? Liked the free internet in the lobby computer room to quickly check my emails post of facebook :) I would definatley stay at the Warwick again.

View was just spectacular from the room. However, important to note - the Warwick puts a $50 hold on your card for incidentials. I objected and got locked out of the TV, internet & minibar. Not that I care for the minibar and decided that a netbook was just too heavy to haul around versus a complimentary business center in the hotel to check e-mail, but would have been nice to check KING & KIRO when I got up to see the weather report for Seafair.

On that note: I walked about 3 blocks 4th & Pine for a great conduit at the Westlake Sound Transit light rail station to major attractions like King Street Station, the stadiums, SeaTac Airport, the Museum of Flight, & the next Seafair in 2012. You may need a taxi connection from the light rail conduit - I would recommend Yellow Cab of Seattle (Warwick has the #) or if you have street addresses instead of just destinations then Sitia may work out as well as a backup.

We went back to reception and asked to have our rooms changed only to be told that there were no non smoking rooms available at the price we paid and that if we wanted a non smoking room we would have to pay extra. We were also told that as we had booked through an agent there was no guarantee of room type (i.e. smoking or non smoking) and that this could only be guaranteed if we had book with the hotel directly. Having explained how bad the room was and that as non smokers we could not be expected to sleep in a smoking room we asked to be moved again and it was like banging our heads against a brick wall. All we got from the night duty manager was that it was their policy not to move customers to other rooms free of charge (we were talking $10 difference by the way) and that she understood our problem which clearly she did not. She would not budge and just kept going on about hotel policy and the fact that she would get in trouble if she gave us upgraded non smoking room free of charge. After 20 minutes of complete frustration we reluctantly agreed to pay the extra $10. And what did we get for that $10, well the room was on a higher floor but not as big or nicely laid out as the previous room, my brother ended up with twin beds rather than a double and our room had a bathroom with facilities for a disabled person.

The onsite restaurant is truly delicious, albeit expensive (during happy hour at the bar there are some decent deals) and directly across the street from the hotel there is a small grocery with excellent ready to eat dishes (it's open until 2am and a bit pricier than most). Cons: The basement amenities leave something to be desired. The pool is not nearly as sparkling and long as it appears in the photo on the brochure, the fitness center is a bit small and the hot tub is rarely functional.

My requirtements for the hotel were simple: 1) clean, and even cleaner, 2) close to downtown, 3) reasonably priced. The hotel achieved full marks in all departments. My room was very clean, especially the bed and bathroom area. And I am fussy about these things. The hotel is just on the edge of downtown, 3 minutes walk to Macy's, 10 Minutes to Pike St. Market. The \"Downtown Airporter\" express bus service to SEA-TAC Intl. stops at the hotel (on 3rd. Ave.) every 30 Minutes - perfect and at 11$ much cheaper than the cabs at $45. The price is very reasonable for the area. However, the Warwick is not a hotel you visit because you want to spend time in the hotel proper. It is very much somewhere where you sleep and shower, maybe watch a bit of TV or check your emails. I would stay there again, but only if travelling alone. I wouldn't bring a family here, not a hotel for hanging out in. The furnishings were several years old, and showed their age. The bathroom was smallish, nothing chipped or cracked, but nothing new either. For example, the shower / bath tap (faucet) worked perfectly well, if you found just the right position to balance the settings on. The TV cabinet (huge) was neither pretty, quite worn, but entirely utilitarian. The big window out on to the very tiny (20cm) balcony didn't shut tightly, causing quite some draughtiness. The air conditioning / heating worked exceptionally well and balanced out the draught from the window nicely. The staff were effiicient and courteous - perfect.

So, location is not a factor. This weekend we booked at the last minute and couldn't get in at any of our normal hotels, so booked a night at the Warwick because the price appeared right and the reviews were good. I am not picky. I am actually quite content to stay at a decent Motel 6. However, this was one of my worst lodging experiences, and I have done a lot of traveling. Let me preface the review by stating that you can have a worse experience by staying at hotels/motels for half the price. I just expect that an establishment that charges for rooms starting in the mid-100s will have a few things right. OK, here is what I liked: - The location was fine. It was right within a few blocks of pretty much everything downtown. - The ambience was good. It is a nice-looking older hotel. - The room was sized a bit on the smallish side, but more or less as expected. - The price was good (though better value can be had downtown at other hotels). - When I booked online, I was given a dollar amount with tax. This is EXACTLY what appeared on my bill. This is usually not the case. - The deal we got included parking (which can be a big deal in downtown Seattle). That's a good thing because parking there is $27 a day. Here is what I didn't like: - Check-in was rough. I had booked online through Warwick's own website, but it took 15-20 minutes and a phone call to the reservations manager for them to find our reservation. Not a huge deal. I realize these things happen. - Internet access was an additional $11 per day. Frankly, I would have rather them charge $11 more for the room and throw in internet access for free. Paying extra for internet access didn't sit well with me for a hotel of this sort. - The TV had about 8-10 local channels, and that was all. Anything else was extra. I have seen this before, but usually only in a low-end hotel/motel. - They put us on the third floor (very near the street noise), about 15 feet from the elevator, and right next to an adjoining room with a screaming baby. OK, I get that they were near full capacity, but we couldn't have had a much worse room. - I am not a light sleeper, but hardly slept all night from the street noise. The sound insulation of the windows near street-level needs to be upgraded. We found very little sound difference whether the window was opened or closed - and it is a noisy street. - Both of our beds had a strange short fitted sheet that didn't cover the whole bed. This left our feet to rest directly on the mattress. Very odd. - After finally getting to sleep, housekeeping showed up very early and woke us up. - Under the light of day, I found red stains here and there (on the curtain, mattress, etc.) At first, these appeared as blood, but I realized they were ink or paint. Still, not pleasant to find. I have spent about 200 nights in hotels and motels, and can count the experiences I consider negative on one hand. This was one of them. The hotel itself was OK. I think that the experience may largely depend on the room selection. We got a terrible room, but I don't have the impression that all rooms were that bad. Still my recommendation is to stay at any of the comparably priced hotels within a few blocks of the Warwick.

When we arrived the gentleman at the front desk was really helpful in helping us park the car and even offered us valet service, however the lady that checked us in I felt could've been a little bit more welcoming but dont see this as a major detriment of the hotel - purely a reflection on her own personality! The room was ready on arrival which seems to be a rareity when reading some of the other reviews, however ours was lovely and clean with freshly made beds, tea and coffee making facilities and bottles of water available (at an additional cost but the thought was there!) We also had a breath taking view of Seattle which only got better as the evening set in as the Space Needle lit up and looked amazing! The location of the hotel was GREAT as a starting point for sight seeing! If you turn left out the main entrance and then turn left again at the corner you will come to a stop for the city's open top bus tour! It cost us approximately $20 for the ticket but I think that could possibly have been a two day pass! Whatever it was it was excellent value as the tour takes you all around Seattle and if you have limited time like we did then it is a good idea to do this! You can also jump off the bus at the designated stops to explore that area further if you wish at no extra cost when getting back on later. Also if you turn right out of the hotel and left onto 4th then right again at Virginia Street and carry on walking it takes you right to the sea front and to Pike Place Market - the walk takes approx 10 - 15 mins but it's really nice - especially if you are fortunate to get hot weather like we did! On our return from sightseeing we took advantage of the free swimming pool, jacuzzi and sauna which was wonderful. It was so quiet and tranquil and the facility is really well maintained. There are towels down there and chairs where you can just relax. It was also very secluded so it felt like your own personal space which was fantastic! There was also a gym facility however we didnt use that but from the outside it looked ok. Finally on check-out the receptionist (a different one) was very friendly and helpful making checkout easy. Also the night before I had wanted to send a postcard home however the first receptionist's knowledge of where I could buy a stamp/post my card was very very minimal. Upon checkout the new receptionist was very helpful in advising me they would take care of the postage of my card for the charge of $1 and also offered me some complimentary postcards advertising Seattle and The Warwick with free postage that they would sort out for me... needless to say I took advantage of this and sent quite a few home to various members of my friends and family!!

The room we stayed in was a bit smaller then other hotels we have stayed at and paid less money for, however it was clean and comfortable (no complaints about the sheets from us). The room had a \"well used\" look, but keep in mind the hotel was built in 1981, so it is 28 years old. We were dismayed that there is a charge of $11.00 per day if you wish to have internet access from your room, and parking was $27.00 per day for covered and secure parking verses $25.00 for uncovered unsecured parking outside the hotel. The balcony wasn't much of a balcony. More like a ledge with a rail, but it did allow us to step outside to see and hear the city from our room. All in all we had a great stay and enjoyed ourselves. If you are expecting The Ritz or Breakers, you will be disappointed and post a snooty not so good review about this hotel..

We arrived very late (after midnight) and have to say I was somewhat disappointed in the customer service at that time. Our room was #1905 on the top floor. It was basically a bedroom off a suite, as it had two connecting doors. We did request to be moved but were told the hotel was sold out and there were no more available rooms, which I found hard to believe. We decided to stay with the room rather than move the next day. Our view of the Space Needle was great although the balcony they advertise is no more than a stand-only balcony. Still nice to get fresh air though if you want it. We had very little noise even though we were right across from the elevator. I think floor 19 is a suite-only floor so there weren't many guests. Also, being so high up we didn't hear any street noise. Our room was decently sized with a queen size bed, separate area sink with mini bar, large desk, two side tables and large entertainment armoire/dresser with an older TV. Internet service was expensive - we paid $25 for three days. Room service was also expensive, which is expected, but was very tasty. We ordered breakfast one morning and it was delivered quickly and was very good. I was a bit disappointed in the concierge - they couldn't recommend a dance club when asked and their method was to search the internet for it - something I'd already done myself but was just looking for a recommendation. The location was great - a few blocks from the Space Needle and EMP and close to Pike's Place Market and the waterfront. Lots of shopping places nearby also and a small Ralph's grocery across the street. I used the gym a few times - there is also an indoor pool. The gym is small but has newer cardio equipment and a nice selection of hand weights. Overall I wasn't too impressed with the hotel other than the location.

My room faced the Space Needle on both stays making for a great view. I have to say that this had to be the loudest, noisiest hotel room I have ever stayed in anywhere. My 1st night there, Sept. 12th, the city was doing road work on one of the cross streets until 1pm, then at 3pm drunk neighbors were yelling off their balcony to the street people partying in the parking lot below. Doesn't make for a good nights rest after flying for 4 hours and checking in at 10:30pm. If you are a light sleeper (or if you have any problems with night noise), request a back room that faces the back streets and not the space needle. The lobby is so very small so when you have a lot of rooms checking in/out at the same time then there is no room for people to even move at the counter with luggage. I find that this hotel is sold-out often so getting early check-in is hard. I found the rooms to be nothing but standard. I wouldn't consider them anything near 4-star, nor the hotel for that matter. I have stayed in numerous hotels around the world from 2-star to 5-star and this one I ranked as just a room to stopover at prior to the cruise. The room was clean, bathroom was clean but nothing to write home about. The one major thing that the Warwick has going for it is it's location! You can walk to Pike Place Market as well as many places to eat like MaMa's for Mexican. The bellman - Joe, at the Warwick was the best employee that we encountered there. He helped us with informing us with which bus numbers to take to go down to Pioneer Sqaure (there's a free city bus that stops right outside the Warwick that goes to Pioneer Sqaure). He also set up our car service back to the airport for us without even being asked to. Just left us a voice mail in our room saying what time they would pick us up in the morning. It's cheaper to take the car service than a taxi so the hotel can arrange that for you. I did eat 1 meal at the Warwick and that was breakfast, it was fine. $40 for 3 people and all I ordered was the blueberry pancakes. If time had permitted I would have walked to Pike Place Market and ate down there. Bottled water in the room is $4 so run across the street to the grocery store and buy it there, it will be cheaper for you. There is no safe in the rooms and they charge I think $11 per day for internet service. Parking is $26 per day at the hotel unless you get in on one of trhe Weekend Specials. If you have a group going to Seattle, we used Shuttle Express and set up a \"private\" city tour for 3 1/2 hours and they took us all the places we wanted to go. It was great and they picked us up right at the hotel.

It is a little older, but it is in a terrific location (amazing restaurants surround it, and two blocks from shopping, plus the new Indiana Jones movie was playing across the street), everything is really clean, with hints of modern furnishings to update it - and of course, most of all, their personal touch made my mom's 60th a memory for us both to cherish.

Looked through the reviews here and prices of places on expedia previous to travelling from Vancouver and this place looked to be the best value, and it was. We got an even better rate with our Automobile Association membership (AAA or CAA). It was $132/night including all taxes - about a $20 saving over their already reasonable rate (IMO). Parking is an additional $27 but they didn't charge us for this. Basically we were looking for an upgrade to a motel and wanted an indoor pool and hot tub, and wanted to be in the heart of the city. This was it, with pros and cons. We could have stayed at a Quality Inn (1/1/2 stars) for $80/night, or The Sheraton (4 stars) for $210/night. Wasn't drawn to either for reasons of amenities and price respectively. Overall, the biggest pro is what you get more than you pay for IMO: Service well beyond a motel; nice indoor pool and hot tub (you'll find few of these in downtown Seattle), work-out room, newspaper at your door in the morning and invoice slipped under your door on the day you check out, friendly staff, easy early check-in upon our request, a very nice bar - we popped in for a martini - and restaurant which looked nicely run with French flair. Bathrooms are granite and quite clean, although a tad worn. Our room had a great view of the Space Needle. One outstanding feature is the proximity to everything, and this is what we wanted. We walked to everywhere over the 2 days we were downtown. EMP - which was outstanding - is within \"Seattle Centre\" as is the Science Centre and the Space Needle. The Science Centre is a must for those with kids; much bigger than Vancouver's Science World with more to do. We also walked to Pike Place Market, and to several restaurants and downtown stores close by. Also, about 3 blocks away from the Warwick is a great jazz bar called \"Tula's\" and the area of town (Belltown) has got great character while still being downtown and extremely convenient. Downtown stores were also an easy walk. We walked to Seattle centre, spent the day, then took the monorail (3 minutes ride) to downtown, then walked back to the hotel. A great day. Cons: Only two, but one worth noting for sure. Our room was on the 6th floor of about 25 floors(?) but much too noisy through the night. Not constant traffic, but intermittent busses made things tough. Our kids had no problem sleeping, but I awoke at 4:30 AM and checked our our window to see if it was open, which it wasn't. Next time, I will request a room much higher up which the check-out clerk said was the way to go. One other con was the beds were too small for me (with my wife). Maybe they were doubles(?); fine for the two small kids to sleep together, but we'd like at least a queen, which we are used to. Again, I'll request this next time. Tour tips: Forget the Space Needle. $50 for the family and while the view is awesome, you're up there for about 20-30 minutes unless you stay for a refreshment. Not worth it unless you're dying to see the lay of the land on a very nice day and have $50 burning a hole in your pocket. EMP- Same price as the Needle, but it was 4 hours of great stuff to do. Hands on music experience, as well as a science fiction hall of fame attached. Fabulous for kids or those who are into this. We thought our kids might get bored. They didn't and since we went after 3:30 (it closes at 5) they stamped our tickets to return the next day, which we did. Can't say enough about it. Science Centre: Again, great value and if you're from Vancouver and have a Science World membership, you get in free. But even if you pay the $30 or so for the family, there's lots to see with a great dinosaur exhibit, butterfly room and plenty more. Restaurants: Of course lots in the area, and we loved the Thai food places. Parking; Hotel parking is $27/day and is actually a pretty good deal for central downtown. That gets you parking for your stay and until 5 PM the day you check-out. Very convenient and we didn't bother hunting for a cheaper deal - what would we get elsewhere - $20/day - so why bother? Besides, they forgot to charge us for the parking upon check-in - we didn't notice until check-out and they just said \"It's on us\" when we checked out. Very nice. Overall, a very positive experience and we love Seattle. We're happy that we didn't pay the extra for the Sheraton, or go to the Quality Inn for not a lot less. We'd go back to the Warwick with a definite note to advise the staff upon reservation that we are \"sensitive\" to street noise, and to place us accordingly - upper floor - which I'm sure they will do.", "Date": "March 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "olympia, wa", "Title": "\u201cNeeds a rennovation\u201d", "Author": "elyette", "ReviewID": "UR14083410", "Content": "I am glad I got a discount.

A nightly wind across the floor... The neighborhood is perfect - close to everything. Room was clean and the appliances worked. I stuffed the bedspread against the window at night, to lessen the draft. Disappointed that my room rate could not include something nicer, or any view at all, but the city was booked for the conference. (FIX those windows!). Oh, and all I heard all the time was the elevator going up and down... so I didn't have a 'luxury' experience in my estimation. The biggest issue I had was that a housekeeper opened the room, and left the deadbolt in the state that it held the door open. I was staying in a single, came back from my conference, and my ROOM WAS OPEN. Spooked me - I called down after cautiously entering. The manager didn't see fit to come up - just called me back later, asking me if anything was missing. Lucky me, I had forgotten to close the safe, but everything including valuables was still in place. I think the manager could have managed to make an appearance in an instance like this, and I have had experiences in other hotels which were less dramatic, where a manager made an appearance to explain the problem. The restaurant is not good - even breakfasts were hit-or-miss (how do you screw up breakfast?) On the other hand, there are wonderful eateries in the neighborhood - try another venue. The staff in the restaurant were the nicest on staff, though! Oh, and the prices for breakfast in Seattle are shocking - not sure why. On the east coast you can eat like a king for $15 at breakfast - here, I didn't escape for under $22 and didn't necessarily feel full. I was offered a discount on my next stay, after I wrote the chain. But... I cannot imagine a repeat visit to that hotel. If I return to Seattle, I'll be looking for accommodations elsewhere.

I gave it a \"5\" because, for the price, there is absolutely nothing more I could have asked for or expected. We arrived in the city by car (crystal clear directions and super easy to get to hotel from I-5 - being a country girl, I'm a little nervous driving my stick shift on Seattle's crowded streets and hills) at 12:30pm. Called the desk from the garage to see if we could check in - No, not yet, but the room would be available at 1:30pm, but we could stay parked in the garage. - Great - At check in a while later the clerk was quick, polite and offered us a map of downtown, some attractions literature and a coupon to Macy's. Another employee walking by, recognized our name (he's the guy I spoke with earlier) and welcomed us and told us he had us in a nice room. Sure enough! when we got to the 14th floor, we had a killer view of the space needle dead in front of us, Lake Washington was off to the right and the Sound off to the left - wow, nice view from our little Juliette balcony! We were in a double/double and if was furnished nicely and clean. And gobs of pillows! - nice touch! After exploring the malls, market and the city, we headed to the pool. While it is true that it is small, I liked that about it - not \"dungeon - y\" at all, like another reviewer mentioned. The hot tub was hot and the pool water warm enough. The next morning the girls wanted to get in another swim and I wanted to get in some cardio. Nicely enough, the exercise room is adjacent to the pool and seperated by an all-glass wall. So I got in my 30 minutes of bike riding, all while being able to keep an eyeball on the girls in the pool - nice! An employee caught the elevator with us on the way out of the pool area in the morning and asked the girls how the pool was, they commented that it was nice and even warmer today than yesterday. The man replied something like - Great, I turned up the heat a bit from yesterday - and off he went into the lobby. It is refreshing to see people care about their jobs. Also, maybe because the hotel is unpretenious and makes you feel welcome, the other guests I spoke with at the pool and weight room were very friendly and seemed to be enjoying their stay, as well. At check out, they allowed us to keep the car in the garage until 5pm...another REALLY nice touch! So the Warwick far exceeded my expectations, especially since I booked in at the AAA rate (104) !!

I questioned the woman checking us in and she said we needed to have the confirmation number. I printed off the confirmation number and showed it to her. She then told me that the confirmation number was not enough, and that I needed to have the price I was quoted in writing. I did not have time to deal with that right away ( I had to get ready for the rehearsal and grooms dinner.) So, we ran up to our room to get ready. When I opened my hotel room door, the smell of smoke was overpowering. I immediately returned to the front desk because I had definately not booked a smoking room. The woman at the desk told me that my room was not a smoking room, but the floor underneath my room was smoking and it must have drifted up. !?! I asked her what she could do for me, and quickly because I needed to get ready and go. After she debated with a couple other employees I was told I could wait 40 minutes while they cleaned it or check into a room on the 6th floor (no view) which was a downgrade from my 15th floor with a view. I had no other choice than to take the downgrade. I asked to speak with a manager, no one was available. I asked to speak with the person that I had originally booked my room with. I was told I could call the front desk and asked to be connected to her, if she was in. We stayed the night, in the 6th floor room, and the fan in the bathroom was broken! The next day, I reported the broken fan, and again asked to speak with a manager. I was told the manager on duty was on lunch break,but I could leave my cell phone number and they would call me. I never recieved a call. We all checked out after the one night, telling the person at the desk that we were extremely dissatisfied. The staff seemed very uncaring. I asked for directions to the Marriot by the water, they could not give me directions. I asked them to look it up on mapquest for me, they couldn't do that either.

No view at all.

Sure enough, they did move us the next day into a beautiful room with a gorgeous view of the Space Needle. Both of the rooms we were in were lavishly decorated, sparkling clean, with comfortable beds. Can't complain about the rooms. The Warwick is within walking distance of most, if not all, of the tourist attractions Seattle has to offer. The staff, however, left more to be desired. We do not have kids of our own, but I noticed how rude the staff was to some small children that were in the lobby our second day there. It wasn't just one person, it was 2 staff members. One bellhop guy almost ran over some kids who were standing with their parents in the lobby waiting to check in, then looked at the parents as if it was their fault. Then, another bellhop was passing by others with children in the lobby and scowled at them for no reason at all. It made me feel uncomfortable both times that I had to witness such rude behavior from the staff, and that would just lead me to believe that this hotel, quite frankly, does not like kids or value them as guests. Our second night there, my husband and I were standing in the lobby, waiting for some friends, and there seemed to be a lot of unhappy hotel guests around us and at the check-in counter.

Admittedly, when we first arrived, we were a bit put off by a rude desk clerk! However, the individual that checked us in was very nice (he gave us tips on where to eat, best way to get to the monorail, and just a general overview of downtown Seattle). I am probably writing this review because I left an item in our hotel room. I was really worried because I didn't know if I'd be able to get it back. (If you must know it's my childhood pillow). At any rate, the hotel contacted my husband to let him know that they had my pillow and wanted to know where to send it.!!! They sent my pillow and I can now rest easy!

The rooms are very dark and the furniture is really old and mismatched. This gives the impression of it being dirty as soon a you walk in.

The blankets were really, really worn, but the sheets seemed clean. Everything else was a crap shoot. My biggest problem with the room was that it was freezing. They have these \"balconies\", which are not meant for actually standing on, which were very drafty and made the room unbearably cold. I turned up the thermostat, but it didn't help. And when it actually kicked on , the smell that came out of the vent was disgusting. It smelled like mold and mildew.

It's a good hotel for the price, with nice rooms, restaurant, and pool/hot tub. The location is perfect, as you can park your car (Seattle is a CRAZY city to drive in) and walk everywhere. Only one problem with the stay. We were on the 8th floor, with a great view of the Space Needle. Late on Saturday night, the entire floor suddenly erupted in one huge party. The noise was incredible, as a large group of young people (not sure if they were high school or college age) were running up and down the hall, in and out of rooms with doors slamming, knocking on doors - including ours - and yelling and throwing things from the balcony to the street below. After several calls to the front desk, we asked to move to a different floor which, in spite of the hassle of having to pack our bags and relocate in the middle of the night, resolved the issue a(t least for us). We got a note of apology in our new room, along with a voucher for breakfast. I travel quite a bit, and have never run into this before. I'm not sure what a hotel can do in this situation - maybe some hotel owners or managers could explain what the policy is? One of the problems was apparently that there were several floors where the same thing was happening, and the hotel security was overwhelmed. The front desk clerk told me that as long as the guests were in their rooms, they were 'following hotel noise policy', which doesn't seem reasonable to me, if correct. In this case, it was more than simple rowdiness or high energy. I heard a voice from the next balcony saying 'Hey, don't -- on those people on the street!'! As well, when we finally did get a new room, the route to the elevator was blocked with a mass of people - on the floor, couples making out against the walls, people running up and down the hallways etc. Anyone have similar experiences or thoughts on this? Or, if you're a parent of someone who was on a school trip to Seattle over the Columbus Day weekend, and your child was staying at the Warwick, you might want to ask some pointed questions!

I think it was $3 draft beers (large glasses and lots of variety and loca lmicrobrews), and buy two tapas selections and get the 3rd for free. They also had $1 off all well drinks. The tapas were reasonably priced and pretty filling, i was very surprised. They were also pretty creative, very tasty. The bed was far from luxurious. Actually, i didn't sleep under the covers just because of how the bedding looked. The blanket under the bed spread was ripped and looked as thought it had been there since the hotel was built and the sheets were all wrinkled. Not the best end to a honeymoon and not very romantic. They also did not vacuum the room when housekeeping came (we had to wait outside at 4:30pm for housekeeping to finish, so good thing the bar had those happy hour specials).

The first thing you notice when you walk in is the stench of chlorine. It smelled so bad. We decided to muddle through and went in the pool. The temp was nice, but we then opted for the spa. From the steam and the chlorine, both my husband and I had to leave because our eyes were burning and watering so bad. We told the front desk and a lady responded with \"how do you expect us to keep it clean?\" Overall, it was nice, but we probably won't stay there again. We found a hotel a few blocks closer to all of the shopping that was way nicer and cleaner and had cheaper rates.

I agree with previous posters that the staff is nice and the location very convenient. The hotel is an easy walk to downtown shopping areas and Seattle Center attractions. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, but there were a few problems worth mentioning. We chose this hotel in part because the rooms feature an outside balcony. My husband smokes, but I do not, and we prefer to get a smoking room with windows or an outside balcony to minimize smoke inside the room. If this is your preference, be advised that the balconies are barely wide enough to fit a human. We did not feel safe actually standing on the balcony, especially with the balcony door closed. Smokers beware: the hotel only has a few smoking rooms, all located on the second floor. This floor is where the public meeting rooms and restrooms for the restaurant and bar are located. We requested a smoking room on an upper floor with a Space Needle view. We were given a smoking room on the 2nd floor. No Space Needle, no view. This was obviously not one of the renovated rooms. The ceiling light fixtures were about a dozen 1970s-era \"cans\" (track lighting) set in rows in the ceiling, directed at the bed. It felt like starring in your very own \"intimate film\". The bathroom also had a paper towel dispenser like in a public restroom and strange pink goo in the soap dispenser, which looked like it hadn't been changed since the track lighting was installed. The traffic noise was incredibly loud, and hotel construction noise started very early. Due to a very late flight, the desk was unable to change our room on check-in, but told us to come back the next day. We changed to a nonsmoking 7th floor room the next day, which thankfully was more updated. The traffic noise was a little better a few floors up, and we had a nice Space Needle view. The bed was comfortable, the amenities average. We liked the in-room refrigerator. There was intermittent construction noise throughout the hotel. Hotel renovations are ongoing; the noise wasn't too bad on the weekend, but I would take care if staying during the week. Also, the smoke detector in our room was not operational (the device was unhooked and sitting on top of the closet). I called maintenance to have it hooked up, but it didn't get done during our stay. We did not use the pool or jacuzzi. As a previous poster noted, the spa facilities are in the basement, and it felt too isolated for my comfort. However, we liked the bar quite a bit. Friendly staff, good drinks and draft beer selection and a nice atmosphere. We ate at the bar one night, primarily for convenience. There are certainly better places to eat in Seattle, but the food was OK and we had a nice time. The concierge was very helpful in helping us select a restaurant that was perfect for our tastes and making dinner reservations. The lobby fireplace added a cheerful, cozy ambience and we enjoyed warming up there after our sightseeing. I will probably want to check out a different hotel the next time I am in Seattle. However, if you avoid the second floor rooms and don't mind a little construction noise, the Hotel Warwick is a convenient, friendly and generally comfortable place to stay.", "Date": "November 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albuquerque New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cBest place to stay in Downtown Seattle\u201d", "Author": "Mezlin", "ReviewID": "UR4104009", "Content": "A great place to stay in downtown Seattle.

They were good for almost $19 and could be used for anything on their breakfast menu in the restaurant. So we were not restricted to just the usual continental breakfast. The restaurant is really nice and the staff very friendly and helpful. The food was delicious and there is also a lovely bar area which is very nice to sit and relax in. We decided not to pay for the space needle view and probably wish now that we had. Lovely to have a balcony but ours was just above the car park. However, it was no big problem as there was very rarely anyone parked there and if you did not look down it wasnt a problem! The room itself was a good size and had a big queen bed.

In room safe, mini fridge, hairdryer and tv all good although the air conditioning was very loud and quite annoying. We were lucky we didnt need it on.

I had made our reservations well in advance in order to secure a special group rate for our company's partygoers. The reservations agent that I spoke with was pleasant, thorough, and helpful - he made sure that I understood what I would need to know about my reservation. Our first discrepancy occurred upon arrival. I had researched, at the Warwick's own website, the cost of overnight parking - it stated that it was $21.00 effective March 1, 2005. When we arrived, however, the parking attendant informed us that it was $18.00 and that we could add it to our bill. Upon check-in, this information changed again and we were instead informed that parking was indeed $21.00. Honestly, I believe that both amounts are ridiculously overpriced, especially considering that other hotel guests paid much more for their reservations and still had to pay this outrageous parking fee. Regardless, I disregarded the discrepancy and signed my bill. I wasn't going to cause a stink over $3.00. The bill was the second discrepancy of the afternoon - our company was given a group rate of $79.00 per night, however, my check-in information stated that it was $75.00. I shrugged this off as well, figuring that it made up for the miscommunication with regards to the cost of parking. The room itself was lovely. We were pleased with its setup and cleanliness and I really admired the furniture. While a fan in the bathroom would have been nice, it was easily overlooked once we opened the curtains and looked out onto the city - what a great view! Upon check-out the next morning, we again met with inconsistencies. Our bill was slid under the door of our room prior to our departure, so I reviewed it for accuracy. Suddenly the room rate was $79.00 again! While this was the rate that I had expected to pay, I was a little annoyed with the constant miscommunication. Not only that, but there were others from my company staying at the Warwick also - they had also mentioned checking in at a rate of $75.00. When my husband and I arrived at the front desk to check out (for some reason, video checkout would not work for our room), I mentioned these discrepancies to the front desk clerk. I made it clear, or so I thought, that I wasn't worried about the small amount of money that these miscommunications involved ($7.00, all told), but that I wanted someone to know what had happened. I wasn't even able to get out that I knew others that had been advised $75.00 at check-in that may be, well, more vocal than I was being. The desk clerk seemed clearly put out by this information and gave me short, quick answers to my questions. He informed me that the garage attendents were still having trouble remembering that their rate had changed and that the company party rate was $79.00. I explained to him again that I was okay with paying $79.00, but wanted him to realize that the paperwork provided at check-in stated $75.00. Honestly, he huffed and puffed and then took $4.00 off my bill. Really? I didn't care about the money. I just wanted him, or anyone, to know that people were being misinformed. My husband, who is quick to tell me when I'm getting overbearing and pushy (aren't all husbands good for that?), agreed that I had not done anything of the sort when speaking with the desk clerk.

We were in the room for an hour or 2. We noticed it was very cold in the room, and we tried to adjust the heat, it did not work. We called and immediately they came up to try to fix. It was redeemed broken. So we then moved to another 4 flights up. We were in this room 10 minutes, and they called to say they wanted to move us again as there was going to be alot of kids coming in for a wedding and they would be on this floor, so then we moved to another floor ( 4 different rooms). We asked if they could upgrade us to a larger room , they said no because we were on a package rate. I thought this was wrong as were inconvenienced. I was too tired to argue at this point. THE ROOM: the really need to redo standard rooms. The carpet is a checked brown and white, reminded me of an old holiday inn. The lights are very very dim, I guess to save money.

That's about the only nice thing I can say about this place. The photos of the hotel are very misleading. Standing outside looking at the hotel, you have to wonder if the photo on their website has been doctored at all. The photos of the rooms were obviously taken at a different hotel because the room I was put in, and then moved to another looked NOTHING like the room photos on their website. As someone else said in a previous review about this hotel, don't walk around the room without your shoes and socks on. Definitely not a romantic getaway (unless you're trying to break up with someone.) The sheets had hair on them. I requested a non-smoking room, but you could tell that someone had smoked in it previously. There was no air condtioning or a fan. Big deal, it's Seattle, right? Wrong. It was 90 plus degrees during my stay. The windows do open though, providing little relief. Cable television? Non-existant. I was told that sometimes it comes in, and sometimes it doesn't. What does that mean, really? It's sad when you pay $96 a night and can't even get the local channels (NBC, ABC, CBS.) Go on the internet for your news? There is no internet, unless you want to setup your laptop for dialup. The restaurant downstairs was a dive. Again, the service was great, but as with the rooms, you could tell that management didn't quite care about upgrading anything. Several times during my meal, I could have swore I saw something scurrying across the floor. The waitress seemed embarrassed while attempting to relieve me of my worries. I forgot to mention the lobby. The sofa was very comfortable. In fact, it may have been the nicest thing in the entire hotel. However, don't lean your head back while on the sofa or you'll notice that there is paint peeling off the ceiling in large chunks held together by duct tape in places. Speaking of duct tape, there was actually duct tape holding the carpet together in several places. The room I stayed in had scotch tape holding the wallpaper over this gaping hole. Security risk? Room keys have the room number and hotel name on the key ring. So, don't bring anything valuable, because who knows how often the locks are changed and if previous customers have lost their keys on drinking binges in Pioneer Square. There is no room service. It looked like there was only one person there at all times. If you're hungry, don't eat the food in the vending machine. Both the pretzels and Twix candybar were past their expiration date. At check out, staff was apologetic for the things I told them, but obviously not at fault. While you could sense their understandable frustration through their body language (not quite making eye contact, embarrased look on their face), you got the feeling that they hear about similar guest experiences on a regular basis. It's a shame because it's in a great location. You almost wonder if management is even in it to make money. I never did hear back from them after I sent a letter detailing my disappointments.

Housekeeping was quite thorough, our room was always well cleaned daily. The door men were always amiable and helpful, and so were the front desk staff. The hotel had no restaurants, but it was within a little courtyard that also included the superb Cafe Campagne which served lovely French cuisine (We had dinner two nights in a row!); Bacco, a cafe that was only open for breakfast, which was quite satisfying; and Marche which we patronized every night for desert and drinks after dinner. There were also some interesting looking shops and a salon in the courtyard which I was never able to visit because by the time we would get back from training, they were all closed.

The staff immediately came up with two tempurpedic pillows. I was impressed. When we got home we were asked by management to take a survey regarding our stay. I happened to mention the refusal of the Orange Cab driver, who took us to the airport, to give us the flat rate of $32, as stated on the cab's passenger window and confirmed by another cab driver, who had told us rates are metered when coming FROM the airport but charged a flat rate when GOING to the airport. Our cab driver stated we needed a form, provided by the hotel, in order to get the rate. Not true! I had also researched cab fares on the internet before leaving home. The manager of the Inn at the Market advised he would refer this cab incident to the transporation authority. I also sent an e-mail to Orange Cab advising I would not use their company in the future. I have not heard back for them---Go figure. Anyway, the only negative I have regarding our stay was the decor of our room. I actually laid in bed thinking a change in the pictures on the wall and the curtains would help. The room has a bit of a tired look and not pulled together.

To begin with, the other reviews are on the mark in terms of location, charm, etc. Those features are top notch. So, what's my complaint? For a top-notch hotel for which the bar should be set high for details, the hotel fell short in several puzzling ways. We checked in late at night; the night clerk was competent and helpful. The Guest Service Directory had a dusty cover. No big deal, I thought. The room was nice but with only one coffee cup (but two saucers and two spoons). The coffee quality in the room was excellent but I had to go downstairs to ask for packets of sugar -- two nights in a row. (There was plenty of artificial sweeteners but no regular sugar.) The concierge gave me a handful the second time so I would not have to come back. The coffee maker was only partially cleaned one day (grounds were removed but the carafe was not washed). A dirty saucer was clearly not replaced one day; it still had coffee spillage on it. There was only one drinking glass one night and a glass was visibly cracked on a different day. There was a bedside lamp in which the light socket had come apart. That did not pose acute danger because the exposed wires were insulated and the switch was on the cord so the socket did not need to be touched. Perhaps the most annoying (minor) problems were with the shower/bath. The stopper -- the type where you just push down to toggle between close and open -- was very unresponsive and difficult to close. Equally inconvenient was the way the shower curtains were set up. There are two adjacent parallel shower curtain rods. I believe the inner bar is for the main curtain and the outer bar for the \"decorative\" outer curtains. In our bathroom, both curtains were on the same (outer) rod which meant that the edge of the inner curtain could not be placed near the wall because the outer curtain's (which was split into two pieces) hangers took up the space on the curtain rod closest to the wall. The inner curtain rod was not being used at all. Sorry for the convoluted explanation but the bottom line is that the inner curtain would not close against the wall so it was difficult to keep the water from splashing out of the shower. The bottom line: these are problems that we might be tempted to tolerate at a cheap motel but, perhaps, not even then. Inn at the Market should pay more attention to such details before I can give an unqualified endorsement to an otherwise excellent hotel.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port Angeles, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Great Everything\u201d", "Author": "HaveFunAndStayHealty", "ReviewID": "UR122201692", "Content": "When my wife and I want to treat ourselves to a great time by ourselves, Inn at the Market is on the top of our list.

Also, there's \"award-winning\" clam chowder (serves a 4 chowder sampler... great oyster chowder & seafood bisque) and a \"world famous\" fresh macaroni & cheese shop... heaven! The other exemplary feature... staff is outstanding... 5 star service. Standard rooms are small-ish, but our 5th flr \"city view\" actually had views of both city & ocean... nice! My personal draw... faux balcony windows open completely and the 5th flr also has a large, rooftop, lounging deck w. beautiful views. Non-smoking hotel... but smoking ok on rooftop or hotel's front door courtyard. Contemporary decor could use a slight freshen and it's not cheap... crowd skews older.

The front desk staff also provided helpful advice on things to see and do and were helpful in arranging other transportation during my stay. I stayed in a full water-view room on the 7th floor (Room 704) and was very pleased with the room and the view, which was of Elliot Bay and the north end of Pikes Place Market. The view was quite remarkable! The bed was comfortable.The 5th floor deck was a relaxing and enjoyable way to start the day with a cup of coffee and a piece of fruit from the market below or end it with a glass of wine and good company. The Inn at the Market is right in the heart of the downtown area and extremely close to everything including restaurants, coffee houses, shopping, Pikes Place Market, access to the piers on Elliot Bay, and the many available tours. My wife and I enjoyed breakfast and a latte at Cafe Campagne, just below the hotel, several mornings during our trip. The room I had was quite spacious. However, it was not designed for individuals or families who intend to spend alot of time watching television as the foot of the bed was situated so that it was facing the sliding door toward the view of Elliot Bay. The television was positioned to the side of the bed. This was NOT a problem for my wife and I at all. The bathroom was also quite spacious, though I think it could have been designed more wisely to include a seperate shower space in addition to the bathtub, which was just average. (The water pressure was abover average though) Lastly, the odor from the restaurant vent below entered our room once during our four-night stay.

It was a really nice touch to get a hand-written note upon arrival wishing us a happy anniversary along with some cute, delicious cupcakes. The staff...what can I say? Everyone we came in contact with was friendly, helpful and quick with any request we had. When the housekeeper forgot to stock us with an extra roll of tp and we called down for one, I felt like we'd just hung up the phone and someone was knocking on our door with it! I LOVE this place and would go back in a heartbeat, even though it was a stretch for us to afford it. P.S. I gave them a 4 for sleep quality because I personally don't like feather pillows and spend a lot of time trying to get it \"just so\". Also, even though the curtains were shut, light from the street seeped in, keeping the room a bit lighter than I would have liked. We put the long decorative pillows on the window seat where the curtains ended and that helped. The bed and comforter was so cozy though!", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cIncredible!\u201d", "Author": "SoonerCruiser1", "ReviewID": "UR117107229", "Content": "Probably the most accommodating hotel my wife and I have ever visited. location, service, friendly people, the best consierge ever,and on and on.

The only downside to being in this crowded vicinity was that the site of the hotel was on a very small lot sandwiched between stores and other apartment buildings. It just felt a little too claustrophobic. The compensation for this dilemma is the wonderful common balcony area on the second floor which overlooked Pike's Place Market partially and afforded a full view of Seattle Harbor. On the flipside, because of the location, it was very convenient to grab meals anytime of the day because of the various delis and restaurants in the area. Also, it was walking distance to shopping malls, supermarkets, movie theaters and not to mention, the original Starbucks just down the hill. Be wary, though, of the many panhandlers and homeless when walking about. If you have a car, there is no self parking unless, you can find a public parking garage somewhere close by, otherwise the hotel has valet service and there is a parking charge of about $30.00 per night. Despite the fact that the location is in a busy neighborhood, the noise factor was remarkably not an issue, especially since we were on the second floor overlooking the street and stores. We had a room with double beds and ample room for a family with 2 active boys. It was clean and neat, but nothing spectacular. I thought the staff were cordial enough and helpful, but not overly helpful. The place exuded a very low key ambiance. Maybe it was the dim lighting or the fire place in the lobby that contributed to the effect. Overall, the room was decent, the hotel was small, the location was adequate, the atmosphere was sublime and the staff were professional. The room rate is perhaps justified because of the location at Pike's Place Market where everything seems to be overpriced.

We stayed in a number of hotels - among them even a Ritz Carlton in Half Moon Bay, CA. However, the Inn at the Market exceeded our expectations and the service we received will have me talking for a long time to come. A few weeks prior to our trip, I contacted the manager at the hotel to learn more about the hotel, rates, amenities and its location. I was provided with all the information requested and offered a nice room at a fair rate and was told that I wont be disappointed. This turned out to be sooo true! When we arrived, the bellman took our bags and suitcases and told us \"not to worry\",..all bags would be wisked to our room . We checked in and were given a map of Seattle, our room keys by the friendly reception staff. This felt so right! Our room was awesome. It was on the 5th floor ..same level at the our door roof patio with the most fabulous view of Elliott Bay. Our beds were terrific, the bathroom huge and decorating a table by the window was a plate of mini cupcakes which welcomed us and made us feel at home. The hotel is located 100 meters from Pikes Market Place, the first Starbucks Coffee Shop and an awesome breakfast restaurant - Bacco's. They offer a number of excellent and refreshing juices for breakfast along with a great french toast! Love it! As we were sitting on the patio, I was compelled to \"check in\" to this Hotel via Facebook and was told I should goto the front desk to pick up my complimentary gift. To my surprise, we picked up a FREE bottle of red wine. Pinch Me! When we left, the bellman loaded our bags and asked if we needed directions to our next destination! Its the little details that count so much! Thanks Inn at the Market for an awesome stay!! So many hotels,..including the Ritz could learn so much from you!

Taylor at the front desk was very welcoming when she checked us in. The Inn's central and most convenient location has been mentioned by other reviewers. We can't agree more. It is literally a hop and a jump to the Pike Place Market, especially to our now favorite bakery La Panier which is literally right across the street down the hill in a less than1 min walk. We love the decor at the Inn. It has an European flair in a understated and very cozy way. The Inn's courtyard is so charmiing, with a lovely sculpture at the center, surrounded by high quality small boutiques. The Cafe serves delicious French cuisine. The manager and wait staff are nice there also. Our room at the Inn has a partial bay view which is lovely. We also enjoyed hanging out at the roof deck common area to see the beautiful sunset over Eliott Bay. Seattle is a very charming city, and we find staying at the Inn at the Market really made our trip so special because of the friendliness of the front staff staff. The cleaning staff also greeted us each morning and afternoon with big smiles and warm greetings. The location, decor, services, and comfort level of the Inn are truly appreciated.

We arrived very early and were impressed from the start. Everyone we came into contact with was extemely nice and welcoming. I did not expect any rooms to be ready (10 am), but wanted to check our bags. One of our 3 rooms (2 Queen beds) was ready, so we had all of our bags sent to this room so we could freshen up. Our 2 Queen room was much larger than I had expected and was also able to fit a rollaway bed, which they happily provided. This alone made our stay better since our boys would be less likely to fight over pillows, the spot next to the table, etc. Our window faced a side street but had a beautiful view of the water to the left. There was a table and 2 chairs in front of the window where I liked to sit with my laptop and look out over the water. We had a fridge/ minibar, microwave, and large closet with many shelves. The bathroom was beautiful, clean and huge. I liked the bath products very much. The hairdryer left a lot to be desired for my long hair. I have yet to find a decent one in a hotel, so I always bring my own. We dropped our bags and went off to checkout the rest of the hotel and Public Market. I have to say that even if the hotel hadn't been as nice as it was, I still would have paid what I did (250 King city view and 320 2 Queen ) for the rooftop deck and proximity to Public Market. The deck is large with several tables with chairs, a few lounge chairs and an outdoor living room set. It looks directly over the market and the water. I went up every morning with my coffee and whatever treat I picked up at the Market. We also spent each evening up there reviewing our day's adventures over a bottle of wine. It was perfect. The location of the hotel cannot be beat if you truly want to be in the heart of it all. It is actually a part of the Market, so you walk out the door of the hotel, through its little courtyard (which I love) and you are there. It was wonderful to be able to wander at my leisure during the off hours than suffer the rat race that the Market can become in the middle of the day. If you haven't been to Seattle, it is filled with steep hills. Even though we were in a great location, my husband's parents usually called a cab to go anywhere beyond the Market. The rest of us easily walked to our destintation or to the bus tunnel or monorail. We did walk to Safeco Field as well (about a mile), but opted to take a cab back since going back was all uphill and we were tired. The hotel staff, as expected, were very helpful with checkout. The loaned us a scale for our luggage (airline fees :( ) They also helped us to arrange a van to the airport.

It's also got free wifi, which is so nice after being rorted by countless big hotels for use of their network, and a beautiful deck from which you can admire the Puget Sound. The only criticism I would make is that the air conditioning in the room was quite loud and would go on and off intermittently throughout the day and night.

The staff was so gracious and friendly, the beds were the most comfortable we have ever slept in (Hypnos mattresses - we asked!), it was quiet, the rooms and the view were perfect, and the location is wonderful (while Edgewater is away from the center). We were only a few steps away from fresh fruit at the Pike Place Market, locally made Beecher's cheese, a wonderful wine shop, the best gelato we have had in the states, great clam chowder, amazing European hot chocolate made from chocolate shavings at the Chocolate Box , and International restaurants and bakeries (from crumpets to Piroshky's!)- all within a few blocks. We had picnics every day! The location is perfect for a stay without a car. The light line from the airport took only 37 minutes even when it is snowing, as it was on our last day. The light rail line ends 3 blocks from the Inn and costs only $2.50! The Seattle Art Museum (now showing a marvelous Picasso exhibit from Paris), Pioneer Square, the Seattle Center (for theatre) and the harbor/lock tours are close enough to walk.

We came a day early for our Alaskan cruise. We picked the Inn at the Market from pictures and reviews on the internet, as well as its close proximity to the Pike Place Market. We were very impressed with our first impression of the Inn at the Market. The great view of the main entrance of the Pike Place Market, the attractive garden courtyard, and the sleek style of the front lobby. Landon met us at our cab and took custody of all of our bags. We met Noelle at the front counter. Although we were early for our check in time, she took our cell phone number to let us know when our room was ready. We were both incredibly impressed with her extremely friendly attitude and helpful manner. You could tell that she was just a genuinely nice person, and that she wasn't just being polite because it was an obligation for her position. Landon was very professional as well, introduced himself further at the check in desk, and arranged for our bags to be stored so we could begin to see Seattle. When we returned a little while later, we were pleasantly surprised to learn that we had been upgraded to a two story townhouse suite. The room was lovely, and had a stunning city view of the corner of Pine and 1st St. (great for people watching!!). I don't recall the name of the bellhop who brought our luggage to our room, but he was extremely polite and helpful as well. He filled our ice bucket before leaving. We were actually SAD that we had to leave the next day to go on our cruise!! Both Seattle and the Inn at the Market greatly exceeded our expectations. We hope to return soon, and will plan to stay at the Inn at the Market again. I would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Seattle. It is located right at the entrance to Pike Place Market. The market is interesting, a wonderful place to pick up some handmade souvenirs by local artists, and a terrific place to try different ethnic foods. Within walking distance - The first Starbucks, The Seattle Aquarium, The Westlake Center Mall, a major bus / train stop (at the mall), Piroshky Piroshky (Russian pastries at the market), Pike Place Chowder (at the market), Le Panier (French pastries at the market). A helpful hint: You can take the train to and from Sea-Tac Airport for $2.50 a person one way. Much cheaper than the $45 fare from the airport or the $35 fare to the airport. It is really easy to use too... just go to the bottom floor of the mall. You can also catch the monorail from the top floor of the mall... we did not take this, but you can go to the Space Needle using this (cheaper than a taxi also). .", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, New York", "Title": "\u201cBest Place to stay in Seattle!\u201d", "Author": "Tommy-Tbone", "ReviewID": "UR78059490", "Content": "The Inn at the Market was in a fantastic location right at the \"Market\".

The room was wonderful and the bathroom was nice and large. The Ipod speakers were a nice touch and we liked getting the Seattle Times every morning. The small chocolates every night were a sweet treat. The staff was always very friendly and helpful in suggesting restaurants and talking about the area. The best part of the hotel is the (almost) rooftop terrace that looks out across the sound. On a nice day it was wonderful to have an escape with a wonderful view. My complaints of the hotel are few, but in general I would say that the basic rooms are overpriced for what you receive. I would recommend paying just a bit extra to get a room on the courtyard or have a sound view, because the street that we had a view of was less than desirable. Also, I'm glad that we got to try a Tempurpedic bed before purchasing one, because neither of us was a big fan. One other thing that would be a very cool touch in my opinion would be to have a hot tub up on the terrace. Just a suggestion of course.

John, the valet, was happy to take my car for me. The front desk was incredibly accommodating as well, allowing me to check in early and letting me upgrade into a better room. Since I had never stayed in the hotel before, I had no real idea what to expect, aside from some of the pleasant looking pictures on their website. I received my room key and headed upstairs. (As a note, there was always an elevator open and waiting for me every time I entered the lobby!) I opened the door to a nice, spacious room. It was clean and bright and brightly lit by the afternoon sunlight despite all the curtains being drawn. I was in a bit of a hurry to meet my mother for lunch down the street, so I set my belongings down and went to head out the door. Before I left, I thought to myself, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really leave without taking a glance at the view, can I?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I walked back across the room to pull the curtains aside and involuntarily gasped. The view was stunning and was coupled with a private patio that was almost as large as the room itself! Now, those who know me are familiar with my great love for Seattle and both its natural and man-made beauty. To be on that patio, standing over Elliott Bay with the embracing cityscape of the Emerald city surrounding me, was invigorating. After a moment of appreciation, I turned back into the room and noticed out of the corner of my eye four delicate cupcakes and hand-written card acknowledging my special occasion. An excellent touch. After lunch, some friends joined me in the room for some sparkling wine and conversation for a couple hours before dinner (dining out is my favorite way to celebrate). The hotel was quick to provide some extra glasses for our festivities and brought them up nearly in the time it took to open the bottle! The night was wonderful. It was so pleasant to wake up in their luxurious bed to another clear winter day beaming in through the windows and through the patio doors. A couple very relaxing hours of lazing around and I called down to the front desk to alert them that I would soon be ready for my car (as they had asked). After returning my keys I walked out the lobby of the hotel to see my car already waiting for me. Soon after returning home I realized that I had misplaced couple items. When I came back to the restaurant the next day I stopped by to inquire with the front desk if I had left them there. Sure enough, they had them set aside to return to me.

Overall the room was the least memorable aspect of the stay but clearly not a reason to not book at this hotel. SERVICES: This hotel has an exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. From the moment we arrived (they set us up with an early check-in), to great food suggestions and a kind valet service we felt like service was king here. They provide a free choice of newspapers delivered to your room (Seattle Times, NY Times or WSJ), the hotel has a free shoe-shine service and they provided taxis and other needs without hesitation. The restaurant (which is connected but not affiliated) was good for breakfast but a bit expensive - it ran $40/couple. If you are willing to walk a little there are bagel shops and other food opportunities at reduced rates in the area. The wireless Internet was reliable and fast/free. OVERALL: Overall we would stay here again. We found rates to be a bit high through their website but would attempt to stay via a package deal. We would highly suggest attempting to obtain a view room (water view) and possibly eating at non-affiliated restaurants to save money. If you want a weekend location where you can walk to everything, have a clean and comfortable room with outstanding service this hotel will work well.", "Date": "November 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sherman Oaks, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay in Seattle\u201d", "Author": "MichelleZG", "ReviewID": "UR48379558", "Content": "The Inn at the Market is a cute hotel in downtown Seattle.

Neither one of us had been there before, so we were looking for a fun place to play tourist and explore a new city.

The location makes it so easy to walk over to the Market for breakfast in the morning and is really a great home base for all your touring. Our room was fantastic. We paid for a city view and had a room on the sixth floor, facing Stewart Street. However, because the window bumps out a bit like a bay window, we were easily able to see out onto Elliot Bay. One of the highlights of our trip was sitting in the little bump out window, sipping local wine, watching an amazing sunset. Our room was quite large - we both were surprised at the ample seating area (sofa, coffee table and chair) and the large bathroom. The free wifi was great also. The hotel has a nice \"roof top\" deck, which unfortunately it was too cold for us to really use when we were there. I could definitely see having breakfast up there during nicer weather though. The lobby is also nice, and we spent some time reading the paper by a nice fireplace while we were waiting to go to the airport. If you don't have a car, the towncar service to go to and from the airport was a good deal and made the trip a little extra special. My only complaint, and it's so minor, was that the front desk staff was not very helpful in suggesting \"off the beaten path\" things to do. We had covered the whole downtown area pretty well by our last day and wanted to venture into one of the surrounding neighborhoods (Capitol Hill, Queen Anne, etc.) The man at the front desk had no suggestions on where to go and gave us wrong directions to Capitol Hill, which was a bummer way to end our trip.

Although Expedia booked us for a city view room, my husband sent a message to the hotel and told them he was willing to pay for an upgrade to a water view room. We never received a response from the hotel despite that fact that he sent the request for an upgrade two and a half months in advance. Finally my husband contacted them a couple of weeks before our trip and they informed us that they had just booked every room. The town car service is a joke. The first time we used it, the driver (who is also the bell hop) didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where the museum was, despite the fact that we had the address and its major cross streets. After driving around the block once, he told us that he needed to get back to the hotel and that maybe we would have better luck finding it on foot. So he dropped us off in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ghetto\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (he literally dropped us off at the door of a homeless shelter with people loitering, smoking marijuana and talking to themselves). We had no idea where we were or where we needed to be going and we totally stood out. Luckily someone was able to point us in the right direction. The driver had dropped us off about four blocks away from where we asked to go. Had I been that driver I would have at least called the hotel and asked if they could have provided me with directions, not dropped the tourist off in a highly questionable neighborhood telling them that typically the bums don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause people trouble during the day as a reassurance! Our second experience with the town car was even worse. We had a dinner reservation at the Space Needle for our anniversary and when we inquired about using the town car, we were told that due to the Sea Fair Torch parade and traffic being difficult to navigate that they couldn't be bothered with the town car. (As tourist, one of the times you need a courtesy car the most is when traffic and typical routes are difficult to navigate due to a special event!) At this point we asked what they recommended we do and they suggested a cab or the monorail. We thought maybe the hotel company had a specific cab company they used, but no, they just hail whatever cab happens to be driving by and because the streets were closing down for the parade not a lot of cabs were going by. We ended up taking the monorail which is about five or six blocks away from the hotel. On our walk back to the hotel after dinner we had the pleasure of walking by a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suspected\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd gang shooting as it took place (two blocks away from the hotel). We were walking when we heard seven gunshots and suddenly we were surrounded by suspected gang members and police officers with guns and TAZERS drawn. Checking the Seattle Times, we were relieved to learn that only one person was wounded and no one had died, but it obviously wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the end to our anniversary night that we had hoped for. With the amount of money we were paying for the room (not to mention the $25 a day to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153valet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the car), I really expected superior service. The view was the best part and it was only \"nice\", it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth all the money we were paying. Either they have really poor customer service standards or they treated us poorly because we booked through Expedia, either way I will not recommend that hotel to anyone.

Landon assisted us with our bags and quickly set them in the room and showed us the room features. Our room was a king, partial water view room, which remained true to its description.

The fifth floor deck is beautiful! It was a little cool while we were there, but we still went to the deck to enjoy the fabulous views of the sunset. You can also see Safeco Field in the distance, where that night the Mariners lost to the Rays.

I emailed him and requested that he arrange \"something special\" for us upon our arrival. We were absolutely thrilled to arrive and find a bottle of Tattinger champagne and the most heavenly chocolate cake I've ever tasted, waiting on us in our room. The hand written congratulations card was a very nice touch. I think that we were also upgraded based on the fact that we had paid for a room with a city view but our room had a partial water view along with the city view. In my mind, its the little things that make this place special. The attention to detail by the housekeeping staff was outstanding. Noticing that my husband had doubled his pillow up for added support, we came back to our room the next night to find an extra set of pillows on our bed. That's just one example. Another night, we had dinner reservations and asked for a cab. When we came downstairs, the ladies at the desk offered us the town car instead! We loved the Seattle Chocolates on our bed each night and the free wireless internet was a very nice touch. We ordered room service from Campagne and it was absolutely fabulous. I honestly could go on and on about our trip, it was absolutely amazing. If I had to levy one complaint, it would be that the TV channels were pretty dismal. I only noticed this because as honeymooners, we were in our room more than we would've been on a normal trip! 4 government access channels, no music, no HBO, etc. The reception was also grainy most of the time.

(you can see multiple reviews of it online) And I mean hard, not firm. If you like any softness with your bed you will not be comfortable. Personally I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m surprised a hotel would go for such a specialty mattress in every room because this is clearly a mattress that is designed more for a specific group of people with back problems, etc. then the general public. Basically it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the type of mattress you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll either love or hate with no in-between. There were super hard pillows the 1st night too, but the 2nd night regular pillows appeared after the room was cleaned, which was nice. And the bed linen/comforter itself was very nice and warm. This a tiny hotel so unable to do laundry on certain days which was inconvenient for us(unable to do on Saturday after 9am or Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) View from 3rd floor was a view of a wall 5 feet away. But if you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t planning to spend a lot of time in the room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 (otherwise try to get a room on at least 4th floor) Some rooms don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have bathtubs and they should tell you before assigning that room to you. Between entering the hotel and getting to room had to tip 3 different people. (but they were very nice) Sink in bathroom was extremely dirty at check-in; it cleaned easily so not sure why it was so filthy; tiny shower head; and bathtub space is tiny (again, not sure why since the hotel room itself was quite large and there bathroom area is actually a decent size) Taking a shower is an exercise in fighting off the shower curtain and not falling out of the tub. And I'm not a big person but it was like the size of the tub was tiny for some reason. Lighting in room is too dark for reading (bathroom had decent light) No on-site gym; have to pay $15/day to use city gym a few blocks away Limited TV. channels (I could be spoiled though since I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m use to hotels having flat screens and lots of HD channels/movie channels); they had the basics\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6CNN, ESPN, and local I find it annoying when housekeeping calls to ask about servicing your room when you clearly have a do-not-disturb sign up. It little things that make a hotel 4 vs. 3 stars. Ie>Just invest in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we tried to service your room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd signs and slip it under the door. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get the message without you annoying me every single day when I clearly asked not to be disturbed. ----------------------------------------------------- THE GOOD :-) Free internet (always a big plus!) and it was fast wireless. Spacious room and bedroom area was clean; lots of space in closet Provided decent robes; iron/board Overall staff was very friendly and helpful. Refrigerator in room was nice for storage of food from Pike Place (and you will end up with something with all the meats, cheeses, etc) Room service was fast and prices aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t crazy. It's the restaurant menu but okay. Had minibar products in room; lots of snacks Bar service in Campagne was excellent with very friendly and professional bartenders Had room opening to cute courtyard but only heard loud noise once; much quieter than anticipated which was great. Doors should have chain/deadbolt on top since they open to outside though. (one turn lock didn't feel secure) 5th floor rooftop is a great place to get a view of the city day or night. I appreciated it was open 24/7 just to go up and view the city/water. Air/heat control in room was great You could throw a rock and hit Pike Place Market, fantastic location (which is their best feature) It's a cute little open style hotel and you don't dread going 'home' at the end of the day which is nice. ------------------------------------------------------------------- OVERALL Overall this is not a 4 star hotel, but definitely a very nice solid 3 star and I would stay again due to location if the rate were under $200. (Even with the bed which I really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like but could tolerate.)

The desk staff was certainly very pleasant and helpful, but at least two of them didn't know how to put us in touch with a company who could take us to Mt. Rainier. There are no brochures available in the lobby, and when the desk person went looking in a drawer, he had difficulty finding a brochure for this major attraction. I finally suggested Gray Line myself, and he made the phone call for us, but then gave us incorrect information (and I saw later why he thought that he was accurate---I don't blame him for that). My husband found out later on that there was a concierge somewhere on site, but in four days we never saw him/her or even knew of his/her presence. The hotel needs better visible information for tourists---at the very least, brochures should be somewhere. In addition, once we did book our tour, we asked for a wake up call that never came. Fortunately I always set my cell phone. We came away feeling that while our stay there was fine, we had had similar \"fine\" experiences in the chain hotels all over the US. We felt that it wasn't worth the extra money.", "Date": "September 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, Canada", "Title": "\u201cYou won't find a better place than this!\u201d", "Author": "WestcoastMom", "ReviewID": "UR19359721", "Content": "We just returned from a weekend stay at the Inn.

I booked this hotel directly and immediately had the feeling I would be happy there. The girl on the other end of the line could not have been more friendly or willing to please. When we arrived we were quickly taken up to our room and famiiarized with what the room had to offer. We had booked a two story suite which was perfect for my husband, myself and daughter. We all had our privacy and my daughter had a separate tv and pull out couch that was made up immediately on request. We all had the same great view of the water and the public market. The hotel has a lovely patio that overlooks the water. It is raised so provides a wonderful view. My daughter and I went out there after dinner and had a wonderful relaxing chat about our day before going upstairs to bed. The only negative would be that there is only one bathroom and it is upstairs (and the stairs would not be good for someone handicapped although my husband struggles with walking because of car accident and he had no complaints) so if you aren't a good sharer and you are traveling with more then your spouse/friend take this into consideration. We had friends come in from Vancouver the last night of our stay and the hotel was very good about finding us last minute reservations for five to accomodate their arrival time. I will say that we were very lucky weatherwise and that on foggy, drizzly or rainy days that our impressions might not have been quite so good but that would not be the hotel's fault. I have also read other reviews from fellow travelers that did not give the hotel high marks for rooms with city views because of noise. However, I always think you get what you pay for. One other big plus for this hotel is its proximity to the Public Market. It is literally a two minute walk.

Inn at the Market is quintessential Seattle - friendly, casual yet elegant, pleasing to the senses, practical. For reasons unknown, we were upgraded to a suite with gorgeous water views (my daughter insists she did not tell the hotel that we were celebrating my 55th birthday). The location can't be beat - in the heart of Pike Market, next to a fine (but pricey) French restaurant. The hotel itself houses a breakfast and lunch cafe which we wish we had tried, as the food fragrances were yummy and the place was packed.

The hotel allocated adjoining (though not connected) handicapped-accessible rooms on the third floor (301 + 302). A door separates these two rooms from the rest of the floor, which features a conference room or two, resulting in a very quiet stay. Because of the extremely steep slope of Pine Street down to the Pike Place Market, these rooms, reached by a lift from the lobby, are on the street level of First Avenue. It is possible to request a key to this street level door, allowing disabled guests to return directly to their room (and the elevators) without negotiating the slope to the main lobby. A bus stop outside the door unfortunately precludes bringing a car right to the door, but a parking lot on level ground is just a block away, and might suit for setting down or picking up a wheelchair-using passenger. Both rooms were very attractively furnished (see photo) and both had windows opening onto the little alley separating the hotel from Campagne Restaurant (which provides the dinner room service). 301 also has an oversized, bumped-out window-seat overlooking Pine St and the market. Great for early morning people watching. Access was acceptable in both bathrooms. A steel shelving unit holding towels and bath amenities was convenient but it made 301's bathroom a tighter fit than necessary; the toilet height, position in the room, and placement of grab bars were problematic. Pluses included the wall-hung sink and curbless shower stall that included a seat with a back. An additional accessibility caveat: the hotel's main entrance and valet car parking service is on Pine. The slope is steep, a potential hazard for a disabled driver exiting from the driver's side of the vehicle.

The only complaint I would have is the TV reception was not very good, and the number of stations was very limited. We didn't even get the weather channel, and this is Seattle in winter!!!

The valet and front-desk staff were extremely friendly, welcoming, punctual, and helpful. My room was comfortable. I often feel in hotels like I don't really want to let my bare feet touch the floor, but my room felt like a comfortable home-away-from-home. I had not slept on a Tempurpedic bed before, and it was very comfortable. The bathrom was spacious, toiletries were lovely, and shower was well-designed. The Seattle Athletic Club down the street was terrific. It is $15/day to use the facilities there, but really worth it if you're someone who needs to work out while you're traveling. It was wonderful to be right in the heart of things in Seattle, too. I enjoyed walking around the fish market, stopping at the original Starbucks for tea in the mornings, and eating at nearby restaurant The Pink Door. The one disappointment for me was the lack of breakfast, not a huge deal since there is a restaurant attached to the inn where you can order breakfast (though it is sit-down, not quick take-out) and many other restaurants nearby, but a slight inconvenience. As long as you're prepared for that, and leave time to find breakfast elsewhere, this won't be an issue. The rooftop deck offered a lovely view of the Puget Sound.

Our room was a standard one, with a somewhat disappointing view of the wall of the building across the courtyard, on the 3rd floor. Not a big deal, since we could go up to the rooftop terrace if we wanted a great view. I will say the best thing about the Inn was the location. Pike Place Market is a great place to leisurely explore, and it's right there. My husband walked down across the street every morning to get fresh hot croissants and coffee for breakfast, and we visited the bakeries many times for late night snacks. My biggest complaint was the Tempurpedic mattress. Everyone else in these reviews rave about them, but my back hated it! I have chronic low back pain anyway (and was 6 months pregnant when we went), and was really looking forward to some great sleep, but wound up hurting terribly. In fact, I wound up having to sleep sitting up in bed because laying down was so painful. On our 3rd day there I asked the person at the front desk if I could get a cot in my room because the bed was really uncomfortable to me and they told me it was against fire code. I don't know if that's the truth or not, but it sure wasn't what I wanted to hear. They didn't seem to care too much that a pregnant patron wasn't able to sleep at all on their beds. Smaller complaints: my husband and I stopped at the front desk to ask directions from Discovery Park over to the zoo, two of the places we were planning on visiting. The girl handed us a Budget rental car map and circled each place on there for us. She didn't try to help us out with the best route to take from one to the next, even though we asked, just pointed out each place again as if to brush us off. Obviously we can read a map and did find our way, but I was once again disappointed in the service. Also, the room was very noisy due to all the street noise, especially in the morning as trucks unloaded their stuff for the day at the market. It didn't bother us too badly, because we sleep with a white noise machine which helps to mask it. I can't imagine the racket we would have had to listen to without it. So be aware of that potential problem. Overall, our experience was still pleasant, though, mostly due to the location of the hotel. The room was clean, the bathroom large and nicely stocked, and the terrace view was really amazing. However, we can't go back because of the beds which is a shame.

The rest of my review are tips and critiques to make the place better or your visit more enjoyable: You will probably hear street noise from your room. Expect it. This hotel is located in the heart of the city, so it's not a quiet retreat. I don't recommend bringing a car here. You'll probably have to valet park as there is not much parking nearby.

Plenty of great restaurants to go to and it is generally a fun area to be in. That is if you are a tourist. However, the quality of the hotel itself is only so-so. This is not a place for business travellers. I might be a bit hard on them especially since I just returned from a trip to HK where I stayed at the Conrad HK and Wynn Macau. Compared to those the Inn feels like motel 6. Issues: 1. There is no desks in the rooms to place your laptops on. Even if you have wireless internet, there is no place to work on but your bed. 2. Furniture and coverings are worned and just outdated. 3. Room 409 is a city view room. The last room they had for that date. Avoid at all cost because its window sits right above the bus stop. They claim that the windows are double paned but I could hear the buses' roaring engines. I had to sleep with ear plugs which they had at the front desk. 4. The AC is a standalone unit attached to the wall. This is not part of a central system. The standalone unit made quite a bit of noise. It looks cheap and tacky too. 5. There is no business center. Only a fax machine located in the basement of the hotel. For the price you pay you are paying for the location only. The staff are extremely friendly though.

The related restaurants, including not only Campagne but the related bistro in the basement and the lively breakfast place located separately within the same building, are really good. But the whole ballgame here is the location. The views, if you are fortunate enough to have a water-view room, are simply stunning -- not only because of the comings and goings of ferry boats, freighters, liners, Coast Guard cutters, fishing boats, and pleasure craft, but also because of the astonishing mountain range visible across Elliott Bay, which catches the sunset in truly glorious ways. It is also a pleasure to be able to walk half a block down the steep hill to the Pike Place Market, with all its produce and its bustle of activity. There are countless restaurants and clubs within walking distance. As gentrification neuters most of downtown Seattle, this area remains edgy, even a little challenging if you go in certain directions at certain times. The area is not for you if you are uncomfortable with street people and occasional strong smells. It is also a little inconvenient for business; and the business services in the hotel are not comparable to those in a Hyatt or a Marriott.

The lobby is modest but comfortable - you'll note that there are no pictures of the lobby on the website, because it's not much of a selling point. The courtyard, however, was quaint and quite pleasant. The fountain is relaxing, and the brick facade with the hanging ivy is a beautiful entry. I had a courtyard view room at the 4th floor, which has no view of Elliot Bay. I think you need to be at the 6th or higher for a bay view. The room was enormous and comfortable, and the bathroom is spacious. The ceilings were high, as expected of an older building. The bed was a king size Tempurpedic, as advertised. If you've never slept in a Tempurpedic, I must say that it is similar to an Asian hotel experience - the bed seems very hard at first, but gradually (slowly) forms to your shape, for a rested sleep - it just doesn't seem like it at first! The restaurant, Campagne, is an excellent (though smallish) French style restaurant, with a good wine selection, particularly the dessert wines (if there's any remaining, try the Cuvee Boytrytis-amazing!). Room service is offered from here, and I can only assume the experience will be as nice. There is a small coffee shop with morning bakery, and that was a delight first thing in the morning. The morning paper was at the door, and although the offerings included the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, I opted for the local paper. In-room wireless internet was complimentary, and signal strength in the room was fine. The location is simply wonderful, literally across the street from Post Alley and well-known pub Kell's, and (in my opinion) a better, local favorite White Horse Pub - DO stop in and give this gem a try! As you can see from the pictures, the Public Market is at your doorstep, and the rooftop terrace has a spectacular view (lacking in most of the rooms). I wish I had a full day to appreciate the rooftop deck, because it was delightful first thing in the morning (again, I refer to the pictures). The energy in the area is wonderful, and you are walking distance to much that Seattle offers.

We had a very nice time at this small, comfortably furnished hotel that has a great location just up the hill from Pike Place Market. The walk to the convention center is about 8 blocks east, pretty easy except for the steep 1/2 block adjacent to the hotel. There are a number of trendy restaurants as you walk north on First Ave. and Pioneer Square with its old stone buildings and charming pergola is south along the same road. And of course, the market is a 1/2 block to the west and has many food stands, boutiques, fish and flower stalls, handicrafts, jewelry tables, entertainers, and ethnic dining options that spill onto the narrow alleys and covered arcades. It was a pleasure to wake up in the morning and grab something to eat nearby while watching the small trucks and vans unload their wares and the vendors set up their tables. Our room was on the corner overlooking the city and was very spacious, with lots of storage space in the wardrobe and a large bathroom. The sink was a pedestal-type, so spreading out toiletries was limited to the glass shelf or nearby small table/shelf unit. We could hear traffic noise from the street, which was annoying, but we did request their lowest-priced room and it is in the city, so I wasn't expecting total silence when we closed the doors. The rooms have window seats with pillows, a nice feature that makes the rooms appear bigger and provides additional seating or a good spot for reading while people-watching. The decor is contemporary, with beiges, browns, and blacks predominating. In good weather, the upstairs terrace would be a nice place to sit and enjoy the views of the bay and the market. The modern, brick building surrounds a pleasant courtyard with a splashing fountain/sculpture adjacent to some outdoor seating for the hotel restaurant. The lobby opens off the courtyard and has a fireplace, stuffed chairs, and the registration desk, where the helpful staff operates. We enjoyed our time here. The hotel is a nice option for those who don't want a large convention hotel in a central Seattle location.

Like the dowager in Dickens' Great Expectations, this old dame hadn't moved in five years (OK, Mrs. Havesham didn't move in 20), and no amount of air spray could cover up the decay. The area around the hotel has likewise declined, such that a stroll towards Pioneer Square had all the patina of a Fellini film, replete with panhandlers, stoners, bikers, and guys with pants well below their plumber's line for ease of repulsive viewing. Restaurants in Pioneer Square appeared dirty and the famed Skid Row area has returned as a flexible homeless folks' hangout. Too bad a city as wealthy as Seattle can't cope with the needs of its least able. While I see a potential synergy between quarters for the homeless and the rooms at the Inn, I suspect the $500/night rates might prove a bit daunting. I continue to give stars for friendly, professional service, regardless of a property's physical condition, and the employees at the Inn are thoroughly helpful.

The hotel was very stylishly decorated, and the lobby area had just been redone (still smelled slightly of paint). Our room was unexpectedly large, and so was the bathroom. It seemed a bit of a waste of space to have such a large bathroom but only have a regular size tub with in-tub shower (and the shower head was not on a hose, which I missed). Still, it was trendily decorated in the Pottery Barn style, and clean and quite comfortable. Our room overlooked the harbor, which was great and made it a bit quieter. The amenities, comfort, style, and location made it a great place to explore Seattle from. The staff could use some work in terms of turning this into a top-notch service hotel. Two examples: 1) The first night we arrived late (10pm) and asked about places we could get a bite to eat. First, the (young) man behind the desk recommended their own restaurant for desserts. I then asked if there were any nearby tapas places (and I pronounced it in correct Spanish \"tah-pahs\" rather than \"taa-paas\"). He just stared at me for a moment, then said there were a couple of places just down the street. Turns out, he was directing me to two strip clubs (he thought I said \"topless\"). I am a 46 year old woman, and was with my husband. Seems pretty unlikely that I would be asking about topless bars, and he must have thought that or he wouldn't have stared so. Didn't it occur to him to ask me to repeat myself, or to look puzzled and ask me to describe the type of place I was looking for? Inexperience, I guess. After wandering up and down the street, and seeing The Lusty Lady and Showgirls, but no tapas restaurants, my husband and I did get a big laugh. 2) There is no place to park near the hotel--you have to use their valet parking, where you drop your car off right in front of the hotel. The second night we were there, the street in front of the hotel was closed and we couldn't get to the valet area. We drove around for 15 minutes, trying to find a different way in. We finally had to move some police barriers on another street and sneak in to get in front of the hotel. The desk was apologetic, but shrugged it off. And it must happen regularly--in the morning it was clear that the street was closed due to bigger happenings at the market on a Saturday. How difficult would it have been for the hotel to move its little valet parking sign and the valets and have the guests drop their cars off at the corner, 30 feet away?

We arrived in Seattle on a Saturday afternoon and to our dismay, every single hotel in the downtown area was booked solid. We drove around for hours searching for somewhere to stay the night. At our last stop, Best Western, we were informed that there were no rooms available. The gentleman at the counter then suggested that we try the Kings Inn. It was already midnight by the time we arrived at the Kings Inn. I had my sister go and see if a room was available. She returned a couple of minutes later and told me that the Korean guy who ran the place had assured her that the rooms were very clean. She then made the colossal mistake of booking a room for the night\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The nightmare began when I was cautiously approaching the room. Several \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gangsters\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and prostitutes approached me and asked me if I wanted to go to a party in their room. They looked like they had been on a weeklong booze and drug binge! When I kindly told them no, they began calling me obscene names and flipping me off! Terrified, my family and I ran into the room and tried to close the door, only to discover that it would not shut properly and had no lock on it! We then began to examine the room and our hearts sank in unison. It was an absolute pigsty! It reeked to high heaven and strange formations of mold appeared to be growing on the ceiling. The beds were shoddy and dirty. The mattresses were sunken in the middle and there were bloodstains on the sheets. They smelled like an outhouse! We were horrified! We decided as a group to get a refund and to try to find a hotel outside of Seattle. When we asked the Korean man for a refund he rudely told us that too much time had passed and he was not going to give us our money back. He told us that the best he could do was to give us a new room. We had spent the last of our money on the room and the car was too small to sleep in, so we were forced to stay in that hell hole! When we arrived at the new room, the only thing that had changed was that the door actually had a lock on it. When I inspected the bathroom, I almost retched! The floor, tub, toilet, and sink had suspicious brown stains all over them and the mirror was broken. Later that night when I took off my shoes, I was disgusted when my feet began sticking to the carpet. The further I walked the stickier my feet became! When I sat down and looked at the bottom of my feet, they were completely covered in a revolting black substance! I decided to sleep with all my clothes on that night. It was around 2 am when someone began screaming outside of our room and began pounding on our door! They sounded like they were being murdered! We could hear loud rap music blasting throughout the night and people partying until 5 am! We all spent a sleepless night, too frozen in terror to sleep! The next morning I was itching furiously and had flea bites all over my arms! Needless to say, this hotel is not fit for even animals to inhabit!

The clerk at the desk the afternoon they arrived was very nice and did not give them any trouble. But the man in the morning was rude. One of the girls on the trip accidentally left a charger to her camera plugged into the wall and when they went back to the King's Inn to ask if anyone had seen it and brought it to the front desk, the clerk (the one who was rude earlier that day) said that he didn't know anything about it and that the maids would have been the ones to have it. But he didn't have a key to the maid's closet and couldn't get ahold of them on the phone to ask. They went back at the appropriate time that the maids were supposed to be there, but they found out that the clerk had told them wrong and that the maids came in the mornings. This place may have been cheap, but she said that she did not feel safe (because sometimes the doors did not lock), and she would have paid some of her own money (that was meant for shopping on the cruise) to stay somewhere else.

Very cool, celeb chef in their restaurant, lounge for a lobby and some serious partners names partnered up: Stumptown Coffee in the front, Opening Ceremony in the back and more I'm sure to come.

The staff is friendly and accommodating; though please remember that the front door locks at midnight so grab that key before hitting the town!

WiFi is free to use and besides your room, you can choose to work in the front shared area with the terrarium or event downstairs in the dining area.

Once my boyfriend and I arrived in the city (around 10 AM), we simply parked by the Ace and asked them where their paid parking was. The receptionist was incredibly helpful and told us we could check in early and take advantage of the parking lot right then (which was a huge relief since I hate dealing with parking). With the room, it was a bit smaller than I thought it would be, which irritated my boyfriend a bit. I thought the room was cute and since we were simply there to sleep, I had no problem with it. The bed was comfy and I found the bathrooms to be incredibly clean. As for the breakfast, I loved that it went until noon (because that meant my boyfriend and I could eat a little something upon checking in).

We were happy with the first impressions. Our room was decent sized and bright on a corner with two windows (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one pictured on their website) and with a Shepard Fairey wall. We asked the desk clerk about parking, since it does state on the website there is off street parking available. He wouldn't tell us anything more than \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if you got street parking stay there until 8am when they start charging.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We couldn't get any lot info from him, so we drug our luggage to the room. Once we headed to bed things got worse. The bed size is not listed on the website and I assumed it would be queen. The beds are full sized which made sleeping comfortably a little difficult, but there wasn't much sleep happening in that room. The room was above a bar, with a loading/delivery zone on one corner and a bus stop on the other. The noise was staggering and continued all through the night and into the morning when we had to wake early to go feed the meter. Also the glowing light from the hall showing through the window above the door was annoying and I never saw it turned off. The next day we requested to move (and in fairness the rest of the staff we dealt with were very nice and accommodating) but we were unable to move until the following night because the hotel was full. On a plus side, the shared bathrooms were never an issue finding one free, and the breakfast did include coffee, tea, fresh waffles, toast, granola, juice, yogurt and apples. There are also piles of good magazines available for guests, and robes in the rooms to use. The second night I slept slightly better because I used earplugs (which I do not find an acceptable solution) and we did again have to wake early to deal with the car. The third night we were moved to a smaller interior room which was considerably quieter (we downed out the music we could still hear with the fan) and it was across the hall from the bathrooms. This room, without anything on the walls, definitely felt like a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd dorm room. However we did sleep better. All in all I would recommend this hotel if you are traveling alone or with friends and do not plan on doing much sleeping, or perhaps you have loud roommates who come home drunk and play loud music all the time.

So if the rather advanced average age of the guests or the number of families with small children running around the place might make you doubt whether the Ace could really be all that hip, the management prominently displays--in a glass case in a small elevatorless lobby at the top of a very looooooong staircase--several copies of the book, \"Hip Hotels USA,\" wherein one presumes the Ace is favorably and fashionably reviewed. But would true hipness so obviously advertise its hipness? And was Seattle Grunge ever really hip? That last question about grunge refers not to the hip-in-its-day musical sound that grew and flourished in Seattle twenty years ago, but refers to the molds, mildews, fungi, and other sporelike or spineless organisms growing and flourishing just last week in the shower stall and on the bathroom floor of my supposedly \"deluxe\" room at the Ace. Yes, small rooms, sparse dilapidated furnishings, and almost-all-white interiors do perhaps appeal to a monkish sensibility. But if you need a closet to hang a few of your clothes-- Sorry, there's not one, and no chest of drawers either. You'll have to make do with one of the three hooks on the wall, because that's all you get. I guess the ascetic style, if style is the right word, might be sorta hip in this overly materialistic age (although the room rates at the Ace suggest that the facility's management is not itself overly concerned with excessive materialism). But the thing with the almost-all-white interiors is that they show every fingerprint on doorjambs, cabinets, and window blinds in startlingly black and grimy detail. As to the sparse furnishings, one wonders, Can cheapness be hip? If so, let me put the question more precisely. Is cheapness hip, when it finds expression as particle-board furniture with skin-thin plastic veneer peeling from every corner? Is cheapness hip when it takes the form of an ugly white vinyl window blind adorned with greasey black fingerprint stains all along its lower margin. The stark white vinyl roller blinds, failing badly as an element of interior decoration, at least have the virtue of being easy to clean. But perhaps too much hipness would be lost with the disappearance of a few black fingerprints. Surely hipness must be more easily distinguishable from flop-house-ness. Okay, the flophouse comparison is too harsh (but after another year or so of downhill slide, might not be too far off the mark). A fairer comparison is a typical college dorm room, which would probably be slightly filthier, but with furniture in better condition. So if you think a college dorm room would be a hip place for grownups to hang out, then you'll probably like the Ace. Really, that's it.--a dumpy college dorm room painted white--complete with crumbling particle board furniture--except I forgot to mention the bathroom in our \"deluxe room\" had a sink that looked a lot like the ones in train sleeper cars in Europe. Wow, how cool is that!?!? Not particularly convenient, as anyone who's ever used a sink in a train car can attest--but how totally cool! And not only did they put one of those sinks in the bathroom, they also put a second one in the bedroom area, too, right where you'd expect to find a nightstand. Since there was no nightstand, we used the sink as a nightstand. No closets, no drawers, no nightstand, but two cool sinks. How cool is that?!?! So when you are brushing your teeth in the morning at the Ace, standing there in front of one of those cool metal sinks almost just like the ones in a Wagon Lits Sleeper, it might make you feel almost like you might have some vague spiritual connection with some really hip place that some really hip train in Europe could take you to. I guess I'm too old to know for sure whether the Ace Hotel is hip or not hip, but I will say that the physical condition and look of the place--the dirty dumpy dorm room style--manifests nothing beyond an immature aesthetic sensibility and a poorly supervised housekeeping staff. My guess is that the Ace's claim to hipness, though perhaps true years ago, has devolved down to a hollow marketing theme--a marketing theme that also serves quite well to disguise and excuse an uninspiring cheapness, a disconcerting uncleanliness, and a run-of-the-mill laziness. Or maybe I'm just not hip. Aside from its deteriorating physical condition, the Ace has other deficiencies, of which the overly \"casual\" attitude of its staff of never-quite-grew-up-thirty-year-old teenagers is among the least serious. Much more disturbing: Almost two months before my stay at the Ace, I had reserved and paid in full, in advance, for a \"deluxe room with king bed.\" Upon my arrival, my wife and I were sent to the small, dingy room described above. The bed would be king-sized only for a pygmy monarch--barely six feet long and four feet wide, which does not qualify even as queen-sized and is actually a bit smaller than an ordinary double bed. The staff placed us in this depressing room with its tiny bed without giving an explanation or apology, and apparently would have kept silent about the switch if I had not spoken up. When I told the clerk at the desk that there must be some mistake and that we wished to be moved to a \"deluxe room with king bed\" as described on my reservation receipt, he replied that I could not be moved to another room because the hotel was full. He suggested that the problem was the fault of hotels.com, through whom we booked and paid for the room, but when I called hotels.com customer service, they did not accept responsibility. (The fact is, I don't care whose fault it was; I know it wasn't my fault!) The Ace clerk offered that, since the rack rate for the room I had been given was $20 less than the discount rate that I had negotiated in advance for a \"deluxe room with king bed,\" perhaps a small refund could be arranged. I explained that, even with a refund, I would not have freely chosen to stay in the room I had been given. I would not have freely chosen to have slept in that room at a rate of a half or a third of what they proposed to charge. Indeed, I would not have freely chosen to sleep in that room, much less to bathe in that bathroom, even for free. Eventually, I was promised a slightly larger refund, which I have since received from hotels.com. Yet even if they had let me have the room for free, I would have much preferred to pay more for a better room in different hotel. Unfortunately, with the \"Bite of Seattle\" in full swing only few blocks away, there was nothing readily available except at an airport hotel. My wife and I were on vacation celebrating a \"big\" wedding anniversary (I won't say which \"big\" anniversary because you might conclude that I'm too old to understand true hipness), so I did not want to upset things by wasting precious vacation time disputing with the hotel management or searching for other accommodations. So, under extreme protest, we took the refund, bought a bottle of mold and mildew remover to spray down the shower, and stayed our three nights at the Ace. But Never Again! I don't care how hip they want people to think they are. One last irony that might provide some contrast: It so happens that the weekend before our weekend at the Ace, my wife and I stayed at the Seattle Pan Pacific, which is just a few blocks east. The rates for the two hotels are essentially the same (the Pan Pacific was actually cheaper if you don't count the refund we eventually got at the Ace), but other than that, there is no comparison between the dumpy and worn-out Ace and the lovely and comfortable Pan Pacific, with its interestingly and artfully decorated rooms, done in a contemporary pan-asian style; with its true king or queen beds; with its sumptuous bathrooms with huge jacuzzi tubs and separate walk in showers; with its well-maintained furnishings; and with its professional, polite, solicitous, yet discreet staff. Instead of splitting our Seattle time between the two hotels, I do so wish that we had just stayed on at the Pan Pacific.", "Date": "July 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cAn ace hotel!\u201d", "Author": "bitsycat", "ReviewID": "UR18082462", "Content": "A very reasonably priced hotel in a great location in Seattle.

I may have children, but I still want to enjoy hip places and cool design etc...so, rather than stay at a boring run-of-the mill hotel - we opted for the Ace Hotel's digs. In order to ensure maximum uninterrupted sleep - we booked our own separate rooms. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were informed that the hotel was full and that there was a mix-up with our online reservation and that we only had one room with a small queen-sized bed (supposedly it was a deluxe room) in it. Normally I would \"suck it up\", and accept that this was just a simple mistake - but this time I was really annoyed. My irritation was partially attributed to the overall nonchalant attitude of the uber-cool reception person - who didn't really attempt to compensate us beyond a slightly lower rate for the room. In fact, as she checked for our reservation on her computer she printed a sheet off and refused to let us look at it when my friend asked if she could see it - wanting to cross-reference the information on the sheet against what we had written on our reservation. It was strange, so much so that it appeared as though the mistake had been made on their part - but they didn't want to admit to it, and were quick to blame the online booking system. There was almost an inference that somehow it was our fault for booking online. To add insult to injury, we were also told after shelling out a small fortune for parking at a lot across the street, that we could have had our parking at a reduced rate at another lot - not easily marked. Once in the room, we found it dingy and not as charming as the photos on their web-site would suggest. However, we did see a couple of other rooms when we were walking down the corridors, that looked a lot better than our room did. Anyway, aside from being a great location and decently priced - it was the overall experience that just wasn't impressive. A few days later I received an email from the hotel thanking me for staying with them etc...\"we hope you enjoyed your stay with us...etc...\" and I responded with an email outlining my frustrations with our accomodation. This is not like me - but this time around, I really needed to air my dissatisfaction. The hotel's manager replied with an apologetic email and offered a discount on a later night's stay - to be redeemed by May 1st, 2008. This seemed like a positive response to our negative experience and I planned to return to the hotel with my husband for a romantic get away. Well, the so-called compensatory offer was never acknowledged. In my multiple attempts to contact the manager with a specific date and weekend in my messages - NOTHING. He did not return my messages.

The early complaints about the windows not having any privacy have been resolved; they've added shades to the windows. The weather was mild so we didn't get a chance to try out the heating, but the air conditioning works well. As far as the noise goes, we stayed in a room 114 and slept fine--but even if noise is a concern, they provide ear plugs for your convenience. The room does come with a Kama Sutra book and condoms, laid ever so complacently by the bed. The room came equipped with a sink, a mirror above it that tells you you're beautiful, a hand soap dispenser, a vanity bar area with a tall mirror, a small desk with a small TV and an alarm clock, 5 hangers, 2 of which were occupied with bath robes, and towels. There's also a very modest snack bar (basically snacks inside a drawer) that you could grab for a price. The bathrooms were clean and come with a heater. Music plays softly through the speakers in the bathroom too. We stayed across the hall from the bathrooms so that was quite convenient for us. The kitchen/lounge area has an HD TV, serves Teaosophy tea and coffee, has a vending machine with very interesting items in there (i.e. Korean Pocky, popcorn, a deck of cards, caffine gum, hangover drink mix, and the standard potato chip fare, just to name a few), a drink machine next to it that has Aranciata (but we have NO idea how the vending itself works! There are no coin slots or buttons ...), and of course ice. Continental breakfast was great--includes milk, soy milk, OJ, granola, toast, and fruit. Light, healthy but quality selection. The staff was very friendly and helpful; we'd asked so much of them (i.e. storing the salmon we'd bought in their fridge, holding our luggage while we went sightseeing on the last day, calling us a cab late at night ... and more!) and they were very willing to accommodate accordingly. Overall, our stay was pleasant. The only complaint I could muster up was that the room was stuffy when the AC wasn't turned on, but that's quite minor. Yes, the mattress isn't memory foam or soft for that matter, and yes the blankets are coarse and Army surplus blankets, but quite honestly, for a place considered a 2 star hotel and for a 99 dollar a night stay, I wasn't expecting down comforters and memory foam mattresses (and am glad they don't have it as I am allergic to down), and I don't think anyone else should either.

My husband and I were among the oldest guests of the hotel, by several years, but we never felt uncomfortable or unwelcome. Justin was so helpful when I called BEFORE our stay, recommending Dollar rental cars as they not only give discounts to Ace guests but also waive the fee for returning the car to the airport instead of the pickup site. (Both John and Jessica at Dollar were extremely nice too!).This arrangement allowed us to travel down to family in Gig Harbor and then use the car to return to the airport the next day. Justin also informed us that we would most likely have to change rooms on the last night of our 3 night stay, due to a snafu with our hotel.com reservation. Once at the Ace, we were warmly welcomed by Jibriil who showed us our room on the lower level. I was a bit surprised as Hotels.com had \"guaranteed\" a king size bed and we had a double. I asked Jabriil about the mixup (never having booked through hotels.com before) and he explained that there must have been an overlap in the booking. The room and bed were comfortable and a decent size with a large clean bathroom. I'm not that high maintenance, but do like to read at night, but there was no reading lamp in the room, just overhead recessed lighting. Jabriil came to my rescue with a small reading lamp and extra pillows. All were clean-pillows obviously sprayed with lysol between uses-but no biggie. The only thing missing in that room was a place to hang clothes and a couple more hangers. On the last night we did indeed have to move to a smaller room. Same size bed, smaller bathroom-a bit noisier as it was next to the stairwell. Still, we were quite comfortable and slept well. So the plusses: Justin and Jibriil-definitely they are the nicest guys, unpretentious , friendly, helpful. The location in Belltown is in the heart of all the under 30 hipness, but we over 30's , un-inked, non-smokers did not feel too out of place!

Staff: I can honestly tell you that the staff at the Ace hotel is and was the best we had ever met.

Small continental breakfast included featuring toast, granola cereal and juice included in price. Cons: No elevator at the entry, so you have to climb a decent flight of stairs to the reception area. Not a big deal for the young, but could be a hassle if you've got heavy luggage. Receptionists seem friendly enough, but you can tell this is part-time work for them, and they don't seem to be all that interested in the comings and goings of people. I've walked past them numerous times at all hours of the night without so much as a look up to see who is coming into the hotel, or to give a simple greeting. Rooms are small, just enough for a bed, and a tiny desk and chair. And I'm in the \"deluxe.\" Decor is trying to be boutique-y, but to me it just looks like a sanatorium. Walls in the hallways and rooms are all white. There is no closet or drawers to speak of, so your luggage and clothes are on the floor in an already small room. You do have metal hangars hanging from a coat hanger on the wall which you can hear clanking at night and in the morning from the adjacent room. Bathroom is ok size, but looks cheap, with only a stand-up shower and toilet with open u-faced seating like in an airport or store, which isn't a big deal except that the towel holder is placed right above it, and to get a folded, stacked, and jammed in there towel out, it's easy to pull out the rest of them which fall into the toilet--not real smart thinking Ace. Naked lightbulb serves as the lighting for the room, which adds to the hostel/sanitorium/potential flophouse hotel effect. And the clincher is tv on a wall arm extending from the ceiling. There's nothing like a tv attached to the wall/ceiling to give you that \"motel\" feeling. Also, you have to leave a \"service room\" tag on your door when you leave, or they will not do housekeeping. They try and sell it as \"leaving you alone,\" but I think it's more about saving money. Summation: For location, and due to the few options available in this price range, this hotel is a decent option. But to call it a \"boutique\" hotel experience and charge a discounted corporate rate of 160 a night for a plain room that measures 15X15 in Seattle? That's definitely not aces.", "Date": "June 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay in Seattle\u201d", "Author": "MattBLondon_England", "ReviewID": "UR5182600", "Content": "Great hotel.

The room gets kinda loud at night but if you can stand it, it's well worth it!! The Ace Hotel is right in the heart of Belltown so you don't have to go far to find the Seattle nightlife. I thought that the \"shared bathrooms\" deal was going to be a problem but everything worked out great. I never had a problem finding an open bathroom (total of 5 shared bathrooms).

It is a perfect hotel for a tourist who wants to be in the hip part of town. The hotel is located right at one edge of the \"free zone\" bus area near the Space Needle.

Don't be \"put off\" by the shared bathroom situation though. The bathrooms are not dorm-like bathrooms where you are showering with strangers. Each shower and toilet is designed for individual use. They were super clean and offered all amenities (shampoo, conditioner, towels, hair dryer, etc...). It got a bit loud at night because of the club right downstairs but... I woke up once and went right back to sleep. The front desk staff is extremely helpful. They are all young locals so they can offer suggestions for any type of tourist activity. They lock the front door at midnight but the key to your room can open the front door. A continental breakfast is included in your room night fee and you should DEFINITELY take advantage.

I'll also admit the hype surrounding the Ace Hotel made me curious. I found both positive and negative hype across the internet, and booked the Ace with an open mind. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the rooms and staff and overall value. If you've stayed at pensions in Europe and liked them, you'll be at home at the Ace. When I arrived I asked to upgrade from my single to a room with a washroom attached, imagining the worst about the Ace's communal washrooms. I needn't have worried. The ratio between rooms and washrooms is small. The washrooms are clean with a focus on white-tiled functionality. The room itself was small but I didn't feel I needed more. In relatively tiny area the Ace manages to fit in a comfortable bed, retro TV, desk and a stainless steel sink, all in an undeniably cool style. More than enough without feeling cramped. The staff was polite and interested, and offered well considered suggestions for food and entertainment. With perks like free Wi-Fi (a bit slow), free breakfast and parking, the Ace is a deal. That being said, if you are at all finicky about the hotels you stay at, the Ace may not be for you. Upon first entering the Ace you are overwhelmed by stairs reaching out of sight; note there is no elevator for your heavy luggage. The Ace sits above the Cyclops bar, a hangout for Gen Y hipsters. The music, chatter and cigarette smoke will filter up to your room. But that's all part of the vibrant area of Belltown that the Ace is in.

I was looking for a 3.5-4 star hotel in the Downtown Seattle area and I ended up with the Crowne Plaza. The location is great however, when we checked in we were asked for a credit card to put an $100.00 hold on for the remainder of our stay. Our room was already paid for through hotwire and I would have understood if they wanted a credit card to keep on hold but they actually placed an $100.00 hold on the card. We inquired about complimentary continental breakfast and the concierge said there was no such thing. Bummer. After we settled that issue we were told that we had a view facing the ocean. Upon arrival at the room on the 26th floor there was no such view. I did not have the energy to go back downstairs and request another room. The next morning about 9:00 when I wanted to take a hot shower, there was no hot water. The water was barely luke warm so I called the front desk and they sent up their engineer who was very helpful and friendly. He mentioned the hotel recently replaced their boilers and that during peak bathing hours where everyone is competing for hot water the floors higher up get the short end of the stick. Seriously? He noticed that we were leaving and asked if we were going to get breakfast. I replied yes and he told me about the 32nd floor that was for members of the loyalty program, which we signed up for during check-in and the concierge never mentioned. At that point I was delighted to know that because the hot water wasn't working properly I had met the generous engineer who had taken us to the complimentary breakfast floor where the service was excellent, but I was beyond frustrated with the Crowne Plaza front desk and can only hope for a better experience (if ever).", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berlin, Germany", "Title": "\u201cCrowne Plaza standard+\u201d", "Author": "Oliver K", "ReviewID": "UR124444722", "Content": "fairly ok, staff helpful.

The heating cooling system is ancient, and some rooms have the analog control on the wall which is fine (though I prefer the digital controls like a lot of hotels have) but some rooms have a wall heater that you raise the cover too and it always looks broken, like it either won't close all the way or open all of the way. Some knobs may be missing, hard to turn, etc. My other gripe is the towels. Can they not afford Downy?! Or any fabric softener?! Those things will rub your skin off. Food in the bar is pricey late at night. A basket of french fries was $6.95?! $12 burgers don't come with a side? If this was Boston or NY I could understand, but when there are good eats just footsteps from your property, you would expect better pricing.

Occasionally if time allowed I would take the subway into downtown to visit Pike's market etc. I've always told myself that I would stay downtown someday -- unfortunately downtown hotels have always been outside of my company's hotel budget guidance. On this trip, however, I started watching the rates at the Crown Plaza about a week prior to the trip. It was just $9 over our budget and I had high hopes that the rate would drop. Sure enough, a few days prior to the trip the rate fell within guidance and I quickly booked it. I chose not to rent a car this trip due to the hotel's $35/night parking fee. We took a cab to the hotel which was $20 from BFI and took about 15 minutes. Upon check-in the front desk staff quickly recognized our Priority Club Platinum status and upgraded us to mini-suites and provided access to the club level lounge. They also gave us coupons for free internet (lightning fast!), discounted breakfast buffet at the hotel restaurant, and a free drink. The room was a two-room suite right next to the elevators, but I never heard any elevator noise <phew!>. The \"living room\" included a comfortable couch and chair along with an LCD television and a refrigerator stocked with two bottles of water. The desk was adequate and included 3 electrical outlets and a desk-light. The only complain I have about the workspace is the desk-chair. I am 5'10\" and even with the desk chair extended to as high as it would go, the top of the desk came up to my chest. This made it difficult to get some work done. I think the Crowne Plaza would be well served replacing these chairs by something a little more work-friendly. (or I suppose I could have sat on a phone book...) The bedroom includes a very nice, very comfortable king-sized bed. There is another LCD television on the wall, and a deep closet. I questioned how well the room had been cleaned because there was trash and an empty glass underneath the bed (yuck). The bathroom is small, but clean and adequate. Both rooms feature HUGE plate-glass windows that span the entire wall and overlook the city. Just beautiful! The club lounge on the 32nd floor is small but very well appointed. The staff is professional, friendly, and unobtrusive. I haven't had a chance to visit it for breakfast but the evening cocktail hours were nice. They had fresh baked pizza, fruit, vegetables, and warm cookies. Soda and water were free, however beer and wine were available for purchase. (in fairness they did have a nice selection). Tully's coffee was also available in the entryway. The hotel is located between 5th and 6th street. The walk to Pike's market is easy and takes only about 10 minutes. I would love to come back to this hotel with my family because Seattle is such a cool city and, quite honestly, I think that this hotel is better suited for family/tourism than it is for working.

Definitely not up to the standard of a Crown Plaza. ROOMS: Very small and bathrooms are also very small. Shower is over the bathtub with a pull across curtain - most USA Crown Plaza hotels have this type of shower whereby you nearly break your neck trying to navigate stepping into the bathtub. The bathroom door is 4 ft. from the bed head and the toilet is approx 7 ft from the bed head. Difficult to get in and out of the shower as the bathroom is so small. When you flush the toilet it has exactly the same sound as aircraft toilets - Whoooosh!! Sure wakes you up if you flush at night. Bed is ok but the pillows are very small and uncomfortable - we asked housekeeping for larger pillows but they only had the one size. All of the suite rooms back onto all of the 4 lifts so you can expect some noise. The comfort package containes ear plugs! Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what we would do if the fire alarm went off! Windows are not double glazed. The suite rooms are not worth the money as they are small and pokey and the bathroom is just so small. We had a suite which we paid full price for on the priorityclub.com booking site but it's definitely not worth anything like the price we paid which was US$263 per night plus 15.6% tax per night. BREAKFAST: Continental breakfast is provided at the club floor on the 32nd level. Very poor choice available and there is very limited seating. Only the one tray of chopped up fruit is available - not much room on the table for anything else except for a few croissants and buns. Very poor continental breakfast as the Holiday Inn Express hotels would have a much better continental breakfast than this, so, not up to the Crown Plaza standard. CLUB ROOM: Club room is on thr 32 floor and only open from 5pm to 7pm Sunday to Thursday plus also open for breakfast on these days. Only a greasy fat pizza plus one other warm finger food type available plus some chopped up fruit. Coffee/tea, water and fizzy type drinks available. No alchoholic drinks available unless you paid for them. Spirits $8, Beer $6 and glass of wine $9. So, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get excited if you get an upgrade to the club floor and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother paying extra for access to the floor as it is not worth it. SECURITY: Reasonable security as you need your key card to operate the lift - we did not see any security guards on duty and the surveilance cameras were only in the receptioin area. POSITION: Good position and about 15 minutes walk to the Pike Street Farmers Market. TOURS: We did the city tour and the Boeing tour which were excellent as we used the tour operator as recommended by the concierge, Christian. These two tours were about the best ones we experienced in the USA as the tour guides were absolutely fabulous and very well informed. The name of the tour operator was \"Tours Northwest\". IN ROOM SAFE: In room safe was available but it was only affixed to the back of the cupboard and not affixed securely to the wall as per recommended installation instructions.

Jet-lag and an extended travel day ensured I slept fairly well. The earplugs were necessary because the A/C unit in the room was extremely loud. I actually got up in the night to increase the thermostat just so the A/C would turn off for a while. The room got stuffy, but at least it was quiet. The hotel appeared to have been built in the 60's or 70's and updated in the 90's or early 00's. It felt every year of it's age and the updating looked like a bad facelift which makes obvious that 'work' had been done. We stayed at a Super 8 in rural Alberta a year ago that seemed to share the same decorator. The staff was average in courtesy and hospitality. I will say, however, that the housekeeping was excellent. Our room was immaculate. I noticed many flight crew stayed at this hotel, and as a stop over on a trip, this hotel would serve well (at the discount rate only!). I would not recommend staying here for any sort of a romantic occasion. If traveling with a family, there was ample space in the room to set up a travel crib. Another oddity was the absence of Wi-Fi in the rooms. For the price they charge, this should be an included service. There was a business center with internet access, but that is hardly convenient.

What further impressed us was being granted a late check-out despite the property being fully booked, our room being actually readied one day in the two hour window we had requested for that day, the restaurant having fine food with engaged servers, the Club Lounge continental breakfast fare was solid but unpretentious, and both of us (marvel of marvels!) were greeted by name after just a few hours on the property. Well done, Crowne Plaza!! The property is well maintained and one gets a feeling of security by the number of staff at all hours of the day and evening. By the way, it is a lovely walk from the hotel to Pike Place Market, central shopping, the nearest Seattle-ubiquitous Starbucks is two blocks, and the delightful water-infused Freeway Park is just across the street. Would we stay there again? You bet. As a matter of fact, our upcoming Alaska cruise will originate now out of Seattle rather than as previously planned out of San Francisco.

Crowne Plaza seems to be located right on the border between its retail district and the \"down and out\" part of town. If you were to walk outside and head towards Pike Place, there are decent looking shops and a very vibrant downtown feel to it. On the other hand, should you venture in the opposite direction (towards Chinatown), you see the less desireable elements of the city. Having said that, the hotel itself is well run, and certainly met our expectations. The breakfast buffet place was great, and the service (particularly of Filiberto) was excellent! Overall, the staff were cheery and generally very helpful. The beds were a bit too soft, but that may be a personal preference, rather than a reflection on the hotel. We were taken aback though, by the rather hefty parking charge of $32 plus taxes. But I guess this is to be expected of any downtown hotel. To partly offset this, the counter staff was graciously enough to offer us free WiFi. In sum, this is an excellent hotel, and is certainly on par with many of the other four-star hotels in the city.

This property is very tall, but pretty small. The lobby area is pretty small and the guest room halls are tiny. Fortunately, our room was at the end of the hallway, but there are rooms that are DIRECTLY across from the elevator, so be mindful to ask for a room away from them or else you'll hear all 6 elevators running all night long. The property is in very nice condition and my room was very nice. I was on the 21st floor with a nice view over the city (including freeway). The room was very quiet - in fact, I was worried that the noise from my TV would disturb the neighbors. The rate that I booked was very fair ($92) and I feel that was the right value for this property. The convention center is only 3 blocks away, but be forewarned that it's downhill from the hotel, so at night when your feet are tired, you'll be trudging UP the hill. The surrounding location (like any big city) is hit or miss. My only real concern was that the YWCA is on the same short block, so there were women who looked pretty strung out and homeless chain smoking on the curb late into the night. They never asked for money or made me feel unsafe, but for what it's worth, it's not a great idea for ladies to venture alone late at night. The YMCA is only a block away and the Subway (sandwiches) immediately next door to the hotel attracts a lot of transient people well into the night (I don't know if it's a 24 hr location, but the restaurant was open very late). Again, I wasn't bothered by anyone but it's something to be aware of. The cons, for me, about this property: * no 24 hour doorman or security. I was out late one night and at 2am, there was only one lady working the check in counter and no one else in sight. * no keycard needed to enter hotel - the lobby area is open to the public and even the side entrances don't require keycards. Only the upper \"club\" floors require keycard access in the elevator, meaning that anyone can walk in off the street into the hotel. I didn't see it happen, but I don't feel safe when hotels don't have a security policy * the Concierge wasn't helpful. I spoke with 2 different concierges (at different times) and neither seemed to know the area well. I was looking for a bagel place and a burger place and neither had any suggestions. One recommended a bakery, which was good but didn't make bagels and the other recommended a chain sports bar for a burger. Both were decent suggestions, but as the Concierge, it's your job to know your city a little better and make recommendations. I took a quick look on Yelp and found the best burger in the city was only a few blocks away (try BOKA). * the Concierge also wasn't familiar with city transportation, so I ended up being recommended to take a taxi to the airport. The taxis are supposed to have a flat rate from downtown of $32 but this property doesn't qualify, so it was $48 + tip to get to SEA-TAC * the in-house restaurant food was just plain bad. I didn't have a room service menu in my room, so I walked down to the restaurant, who then referred me to the bar. Everyone was thoroughly perplexed on how to create a \"to go\" order (I would have been fine with room delivery, but they said no). Food was done fast, but it was all pre-made stuff (salad dressing from a jar, frozen burger patty, etc.). The price was fair, since I ordered it in the bar ($2 cheaper than the restaurant) but I wouldn't eat there again.", "Date": "March 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel With Excellent Staff\u201d", "Author": "skyguyWI", "ReviewID": "UR99586817", "Content": "I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza-downtown Seattle for years whenever I travel to Seattle.

We didn't eat on site so I have no comment about that. Also one small thing is there is not a pool ar a hot tub but I kjnew this before bookuing so it was not a big deal.

It is very clean and almost spotless. We are surprised to see that our room is in excellent shape; obviously it is well maintained and well kept. The location is excellent, it is minutes of walk from the major shopping centers, Pike Place Market. I would have to say this hotel can cover many of the popular places in downtown. The room quality is excellent, we were given two queen beds. The room comes with a 32\" TV, a desk, a mini-fridge, wireless internet with a relatively quiet AC. The wireless internet did not work, and we had to call front-desk for a password instead. Another problem with the room is that by the next morning, the windows is full of condensation when the room temp is kept at only 15C. Service is great as well, our hair-dryer is broken. We were given another one in about 15 min after calling the front desk. Since our room is prepaid and check-in and out are very quick. We haven't use any of the services so I cannot comment on others. We get this hotel by random as we bid this online. Value wise I have no other comments except excellent! Sleep qualility is great too, I was able to get at least 8 hours of sleep. The bed and pillow is firm enough that they don't sag. Overall, we are very happy with Crowne Plaza.

Although this may be true and the hotel is similar to its competitors in this respect, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that CPS is worth what the regular rate is for a room per night. Like most metro hotel locations you are paying for location and branding, certainly not for special perks, free services, free parking or other things I think are necessary to justify a premium price from a hotel. Normally I would not choose to stay at a high-end location such as this on my own dime, however I had a discount available to me, which made the price of the room hard to beat. Upon arriving you are met by pleasant, but visually overworked doormen and bellhops looking to earn a tip. The staff at the front desk is especially courteous, however a computer snafu befuddled the front desk clerk for a few minutes, causing them to ask for the spelling of my name a number of times over and over again and at least one phone call to a supervisor to find my reservation. Crisis averted and reservation found, the clerk returned to her previous calm self and finished my check-in. I had specified a single king bed room, however I was given a 2 double bed room. That didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter too much. It was a corner room with an excellent view of I-5 and the west side of Downtown Seattle. I realized why the corner room also had 2 beds, it was because the non-corner rooms in the hotel are too small for 2 queen beds. The room had the normal toiletries, coffee maker and magazines and guidebooks to the local area. There was also a packet containing some aromatherapy spray, a sleep mask and earplugs. On each of the drapes was a clip, branded as part of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sleep assurance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd program. I definitely liked the idea and wished that other hotels offered the same thing. The biggest issue with the corner room was the noise from I-5. Oh, never mind, that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the biggest issue; it was the mattress. The mattress was horrible. The worst I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever slept on in any 4+ star hotel. Every time I rolled around a spring made a pop or whine noise and by morning, my wife and myself were both glad to be done with the night and glad we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleeping on this bed another night. I was also surprised about the towels. Towels in places like this are typically very plush and generally nice to use. However all of the towels in the room were thin and harsh to use. These towels were worthy of a Motel 6 or Super 8, but not a Crown Plaza. The towels were clean and bright white, but a location of this caliber should have had much better linens. Bed linens weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much better. I have nicer sheets at home and I purchased them from Costco. In general the Crown Plaza Seattle left me with mixed feelings. If the place was a 3 star property or lower, then the mattress, towels and bed linens would have been excusable, however that just isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the case. A high-end downtown property that prides itself in being a 4-star or better location should do much better in all the above areas.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay at Crowne Plaza Seattle!\u201d", "Author": "shopaholicinvan", "ReviewID": "UR84686872", "Content": "We had a girl's weekend shopping through Seattle and my friend booked Crowne Plaza Seattle (CPS) on Hotwire for a one night stay in June.

This was around midnight and the phones kept ringing and ringing. She then called concierge, again, it kept ringing. No answer at the valet desk either. We tried again in 10 minutes and again, no one answered their phones. Same went for the next morning when we tried calling valet. We called back 10 minutes to hear an out of breath valet answering the phone. There's only one attendant on duty at 9am? The bathroom also lacked a fan so the room became quite muggy. The tile used in the bathroom was also slippery; be careful if you step out of the shower. There also wasn't a place to hang your towels; only the shelve above the toilet (which isn't the most sanitary location). CPS also had slow elevators. It took over 10 minutes to finally hail an elevator from Ground Floor. There are only two serviceable elevators and while we were waiting, we came across the hotel manager who gave up after 5 minutes and left after we commented to him that the elevator is slow. This was especially a problem around dinner time when there were 30 people waiting in the lobby for the elevator. We gave up and sat in the lobby to wait until the crowds cleared. On the issue of parking, you also had to valet your car with Crowne Plaza as there wasn't an option to park it yourself. This service took a while as well. After our stay, my friend wrote in to Crowne Plaza Seattle to inform them of the problems encountered during our stay. She sent her email in twice and we still have not heard back from management since her emails in JUNE 2010.

I used Hotwire to book, and so didn't actually choose this location, it came up on Hotwires rotation. Cons: - After leaving my car with the valet, learned that parking is $37 a night. $20 is the going rate in this area. - Checking in, learned that an upgrade is required for rooms on 'club floors' which contain amenities standard in other similar properties, such as a mini-fridge, etc - Heater in room is so loud during operation that it is impossible to watch tv, listen to music, etc, without constantly changing volume whenever heater turns on. - There is a $10 a day charge for wi-fi. A ridiculous fee considering every hotel I have stayed at for the last few years provides this as a complimentary service. Also, after paying the fee, the connection was almost unusably slow; impossible to stream movies via netflix, youtube, etc. - Room service fees were exorbitant. The $14 chicken on the menu was $37 with delivery fees. - Bathroom has one of the strangest toilets I've ever seen. The seat rim is approximately 6\" from the floor, which puts your knees at chest level when seated. Also my balls were hanging in the water when seated.

The biggest disappointment was that we had been looking forward to our stay and it was just a little bit of a let down. The front desk staff were a just not functioning and if they could get it wrong they did. Our first night late check in after a 27 hours of travel and a 9 hour time difference was a nightmare. On the other hand Silver from the front desk team, Terry the Concierge and Cristy Smith General Manager were superb. We had a Suite 3156 for the first stay and really were very disappointed at the shabbiness and age of the fixtures fittings etc. An overhaul is long due. On our second stay we had 3356 and this had been marginally updated but was still not all one would expect. On the bright side everything was very clean, a more than ample supply of towels and the usual superb Crowne Plaza beds. The Executive Lounge is too small for the number of rooms described as \"Executive\". It too is desperately in need of a total overhaul. We were most amused when at 3.30 in the afternoon standing beside the sign stating that the lounge is open 24 hours for the use of Executive Level guests to be told by a staff member \"We only open at 5\". We quickly discovered that if one was walking to the hotel from the front area the best way was to always use Pine Street and then along either 5th or 6th Avenue to Seneca. The other nearby roads all had pretty steep hills back to the hotel.

I was looking for a hotel with a price range of $150 to $200 (including taxes) therefore, after looking at the reviews in trip advisor regarding different hotels; I decided that The Crown Plaza was a good match for us. I found out that the Crown Plaza is one of the few hotels that offer a nice Pre-cruise package. We booked the Pre-Cruise plan with a King size bed. The room was located on the floor 27 and it was a corner room. We were able to see most of the downtown area and the Space needle from our room. The room and bathroom were very spacious and clean. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. We arrived at 11:30 AM and our room was not ready, but we were able to leave our suitcases with the door man and go to explore the city. By the time we came back to the hotel (around 5:00 PM) our room was ready. As part of the package, breakfast and transfer from the hotel to the pier were included. The breakfast was a buffet breakfast and it was good. As a matter of fact I really enjoyed the coffee that was served during breakfast. I even asked the waiter where I could buy that kind of coffee in Seattle, the waiter told me that he did not know but he was going to ask. A few minutes later, the hostess came to our table and she gave us as a gift, a bag of (1/2lb) of their coffee. I was very impressed by that. The service at the restaurant was very good. The staff at their front desk and the lady in charge of scheduling our transportation to the pier was very friendly and courteous with us. Unfortunately, some of the customers who were in the reception area were very unfriendly and uptight. The only complaint that we had was regarding the Wi-Fi connection. The service is not free, my SO was trying to update his Facebook status and check his e-mails and we did not want to pay the extra $$ for that service. Fortunately, he was able to pick up a free Wi-Fi connection when we were strolling in downtown. There are hundreds of Wi-Fi networks out there.

The hotel itself is designed so that the rooms have excellent views and they do. The rooms are large and have all the typical Crowne Plaza amenities, but the beds here were just a bit more firm than most Crowne Plazas, almost too hard for me. While management has clearly added enough updates to bring this hotel up to par with most in its class, the bathrooms could use more updates like newer sinks/tubs. My sink fixture didn't work well and the tub and faucet looked old. Since this is a very tall hotel, having a good elevator is important, but they are undergoing a major elevator repair project right now and that leaves only one or two working at one time which really backs things up. They need to speed ahead with the project to limit inconveniences. This hotel's location is just a bit farther from some of the fun stuff that I'd like. Ideally it would be closer to Pike Place Market and the Waterfront, but you can probably get a better price here than most of the other higher class downtown hotels. Seattle itself is a great tourist destination with lots to do. You can walk almost anywhere in downtown here and when you get tired, the buses are free in the downtown zone before 7 p.m. They also have convenient bus service to SeaTac from the new transit tunnel that will turn into the light rail stations in 2009.

After waiting 10 minutes for an elevator, I opted to get on the 'going up only' elevator, that stopped at every floor (32 of them) then quickly descended to the main floor. NOTE: the hotel staff did admit work was being done on the elevators, however two working elevators for a 32 story hotel is unacceptable. - Room carpet needed cleaning, and the dark walls and decor prompting turning on every light in the room to navigate. Hotel room colors are brown, dark orange, and medium yellow. - Lounge wait staff was very friendly, and service was good. - This hotel is right off the freeway and if you're traveling by taxi, it's easy to get out of the cab and enter the hotel. If you're renting a car and staying at the hotel, there is no space in front of the hotel to leave your car, check in and park. So plan to park your car in the garage and then take your bags with you to check in to the hotel. - If you're okay with horns honking, the freeway exit ramp is located at the hotel entrance, as well as a major left turn from a main street. Any congestion in front of the hotel will prompt usually polite Seattle drivers to honk once or twice to remind folks that the front area of the hotel is a live street lane.

The room had a tv, desk, coffee pot, sleep kit for relaxation, a lounge chair and king size bed with night stands on either side. It also had plenty of lighting which was good for business. The hotel restaurant had decent food . . . it was moderately priced. The bar had a cheaper menu with sandwhiches and soups if you preferred. They would also prepare your food so you could take it to your room. The hotel also had room service but I needed a temporary break from the room. The hotel also had a gift shop with lots of things that you may have forgotten. The business center was ridiculously expensive to use. The free fitness room looked good - decent amount of equipment. The hotel is only about 5 blocks from the Westlake Center shopping and the monorail to the Space Center. You can easily walk to it. Also, if you are in the touristy area of Seattle, you can take the buses for free between 6am-7pm. Grab a Seattle Map and look for the key to the free bus area.

We were able to get the government/military rate since my husband is active duty Army, which was around $170 for a club level room, which was supposed to include free evening appetizers and a free continental breakfast. We figured that was a good rate for a room on a high floor and basically four free meals, but little did we know that the club level lounge is CLOSED on Friday and Saturday nights! So we got two free breaksfasts. We did receive a coupon for one free appetizer in the Regatta Lounge (the bar inside the hotel) upon check-in. Another problem that we had was that the guest that had stayed in the room we were to occupy that night apparently did not check out. This was the day after the nightmare at the airports because of the foiled terrorist attack, and so I can understand someone changing their travel plans, but they tried to put us in a room that was subpar to what we had reserved. After a few choice words, the manager \"found\" a room on the 32nd floor and gave us one night of garage parking for free, a $27 value. We had suspicions that this room was probably in the remodeling stage, as there was a loose tile in the bathroom floor and a few small cracks where the ceiling met the walls. Even with the loose tile, the highlight of the room was the bathroom - all marble, new fixtures, a great shower, and lots of towels and toiletries. The other highlight was the bed, which was very comfortable. A few nice touches include the sleep kit, with a music CD and an eye mask; the blackout curtains, which fooled me into thinking it was still dark outside when really the sun was already up; and the hotel escape plan on the door actually lit up at night. It was a very faint light and didn't disturb our sleep at all, and I had never seen this before. I thought it was very clever. I didn't think the elevators were slow at all; we waited one time for maybe three minutes, but otherwise it was just a few seconds. They have a pretty good happy hour in the bar twice daily, and the hotel is within walking distance to everywhere. Even though we could take our car as often as we pleased, it didn't move for two days because we walked everywhere. Overall it was okay, but I think there are nicer hotels downtown for about the same price. If you are in town for a conference and don't really care about the amenities, then this hotel is for you. But if you want to be pampered, go somewhere else. Last year we stayed at the Grand Hyatt, and it was absolutely great. If you can afford it, stay at the Fairmont Olympic - it is divine. If you can't afford it, do what we did and just walk through.

This particular staff member went to speak quietly with another front desk staff member and they both agreed on a particular room for us. When we entered the room, the smell of cigarette smoke was very apparent, and yet we could not imagine that the front desk staff would intentionally put us in a smoking room without informing us. Two days later, we discovered an ashtray and matches and checked with the front desk to discover that in fact we had been put in a smoking room intentionally because they had not kept our reserved nonsmoking room for us. All our clothes and other belongings as well as our baby reeked of cigarette smoke. In addition to this appalling lack of concern for our health and wishes, our room was not serviced during our three night stay. When I asked the front desk manager why our room had not been serviced, he checked with housekeeping and informed me that we had had a do not disturb tag on our door so they did not disturb us. This was not the case (the tag was on the inside of our door the entire time) and I had anxiously been awaiting staff to empty our garbage of dirty diapers and replace our towels. The front desk manager offered us the pathetic compensation of a complimentary hotel breakfast for my family being exposed to carcinogenic cigarette fumes for days and not having our rooms cleaned.

It is a very nice hotel overall, but there are two things that really irked me: 1) The hotel advertises wireless internet access. It costs $9.95/night. I also could not find any open access nearby, even if I sat in the window. The hotel has a self-serve business center, but charges way too much. Beware: you cannot upload files from the computers in the business center. I needed to send a document on my jump drive, and the computer displayed a \"blocked\" message. 2) The six elevators are VERY slow. You could easily wait ten minutes or more for one to come. You can always take the stairs, but that's not always an option if you're on the 14th floor (I was) or above. Ice machines are located on every other floor; as with soda machines. Soda is $2 for a 20oz bottle. The ice machines are very noisy and are inclosed in a room with a door. There is a large fan next to the door to provide ventilation to the room, which adds to the noise. Due to the size of the hotel, there are very few rooms on each floor. This means that it's very quiet. At almost any hotel, you're going to get some noise. I was pleased that the only thing I heard was one of my roomates snoring. This was easily drowned out by the sleep kit that the hotel provides on the first night. The kit contained ear plugs, an eye mask, a relaxing sounds CD (didn't listen to it), and lavendar spray. Also, the windows are very well insulated, almost no noise or cold came in. The couches in the lobby are very very comfortable; I could have slept on them. The in-house confernece facilities are small, but are very nice. My limited interactions with the hotel staff were pleasant. I didn't need much from them, so I had no reason to speak with them. Extra sheets were delivered within 10 minutes. The hotel guarentees wake up calls within 5 minutes or your stay is free, so you might as well get one. They lived up to their claims. The hotel is within walking distance of many other hotels and downtown attractions. It is only two blocks away from the main bus line. The busses are free inside Downtown Seattle. It is very convienent to hop on a bus and get off in 2 blocks, but the busses don't run this far east, so you have to walk 2 blocks. Getting to the Washington State Convention and Trade Center was very easy thanks to a shortcut pointed out by one of the attendees. I don't know what the name of the building was, but it's the one at 7th & Union. There is an underground retail center where free WiFi was available. Overall, I'd stay in this hotel again.

Our friends who stayed in the inter-connecting room next door (our only request that was granted) were not as lucky. They are non-smokers as well, but the room they were in was definately not. My friend's girlfriend actually got a headache because the stench was so overpowering. (The hotel allowed them to switch to a non-smoking room for the second night of their stay.)

However, we didn't really hear too much noise from the hallways or elevators because the air conditioning was pretty loud and covered the outside noise. We had a 2 double bed room, with a nice view of I-5. My son loved the view because he could see the cars on the freeway. We asked for a King Bed, but the lady at the front desk said they didn't have any available. I'm also wondering if people who book through Hotwire get the rooms by the elevators? Because my mom also was assigned a room by the elevator and she booked through Hotwire. The room itself was pretty spacious. Enough room for my 2 1/2 year old son to play with his toys. However, the bathroom was pretty tiny. The shower was regular sized and with good water pressure. Conditioning shampoo, mouthwash, lotion, and facial soap were supplied. Crowne Plaza does try to add some little details we noticed in the room. Upon arrival, there is a little red bag filled with ear plugs, eye mask and linen spray on the bed. Also, a CD with soft music. In the bathroom there was also a nightlight and on the curtains there was a clip to keep the light out. Very nice touch. The beds were decent. The room was quite dry and we all had a hard to sleeping because our throats became very dry. The main reason we were in Seattle was to visit the Northwest Flower & Garden Show held at the Convention Center. The hotel was in a very good location. We were able to walk through Freeway Park and end up directly on the 4th floor entrance to the Convention Center in about 5-10 minutes. Pacific Place Shopping Center is about 5 blocks away, WestLake is about 7 blocks away and Pike Place is about 10 blocks. Walking around at night was a little scary because there are a lot of homeless people and also a lot of people who were smoking weed and begging for money. It didn't exactly feel safe. During the day it was OK. There is no self-parking in the hotel. Only Valet service. It was quite expensive at $27/night. We did notice a public parking lot up one block for $12/day.

The airport in Punta Cana is a wonderful, traditional open air airport. From the start you are put into the tropical mood by getting off the plane by walking down the steps onto the tarmac. The open air airport really gives you a feel of going back in time. Domincan clad ladies greet you and take a picture as you arrive which you can purchase on your departure for 8.00 US. We were then off to our van to be on our way to the resort, this drive was about 20 minutes or so. We were early but were given our room about an hour after we arrived so we went to have lunch at the El Behique beach buffett. Upon arrival the resort is breathtakingingly beautiful. After lunch we were assigned our rooms. Our freinds and us both got ground floor rooms which was dissapointing at first but we came to love not having to trek up the marble steps every day after a long day at the beach. They put us down the hall from each other which was very convienient. We had several issues with our room, it was musty and I always read this on your site and think the people are just being picky since it is a beach resort that you should expect it but this place really was musty. We found that our air conditioning did not cool to a proper tempurature and my Husband addressed this with the front desk 6 times and it was never resolved but we made do. We left our key card in the slot so that it would run all the time and it made it bearable. Our freinds room was fine and there air kept there room very cool. Our lighting was weird, you had to have the lights on at the sink to work the light in the bathroom area which was alright except for in the middle of the night when you would get up to go to the bathroom. Other than these issues everything was great and we could have changed rooms the next day but I did not want to bother with packing up everything again just to move. Our only negative issue was the food. We have been to many resorts all over the Carribean and this by far was the worst food I have ever had at any. I can not pin point if it was the style of the food or just the food itself. There were not many American's there. Most of the people were from Europe so maybe they were catering to the tastes of them but we really did not enjoy it at all. We basically only liked the Italian restaraunt, we went there 4 times and hit the pasta bar at the buffetts also. The guys would only eat pizza and french fries closer to the end of our two weeks because they had major bathroom issues. Nobody got actually sick in our party but it did go straight through so take your pepto and immodium. Breakfast was pretty good since you could get pancakes and waffles and french toast. We hated the coffee, it was way tooooo strong for us and like I said before this was just our preferance, the Europeans loved it. My freind and I took advantage of the spa on one day and were dissapointed, it was more like a gym inside a spa. You had to share the two large jacuzzies with other people although they will include them in your spa package like your getting a private jacuzzi soak and the massage was good but other than that it was not really worth taking time out of your vacation for it. I would opt for a massage on the beach instead of using the spa itself. Nobody speaks English at this resort so most of our issues may have spanned from not being able to get across what we needed or wanted but you really cannot complain about that since we were the minority and there are so many languges these people would have to learn to please everyone there. I would say the majority would be Spanish and French. There were some German but not many. All in all it was a nice stay, the jacuzzie's in the rooms were nice. The beach was just heavenly and this saved the whole vacation for us. We have never seen a more beautiful sky or beach or large palm trees. The grounds are gorgeous and everything is very pretty. The good thing is none of us gained any weight on our vacation so this actually worked in our favor. The sports bar is really nice and we also took the Saona Island tour which was awsome and we highly recommend it. Go and have a great time!!! Book the Suites though if you want more romance and quiet since it is an all adult beach/pool. Our pool bar was the best!

We stayed at the Royal Suites portion of the Grand Palladium and were very pleased. Here are our thoughts....feel free to email if you have questions about any of the palladium sections. we did a lot of walking around and comparing. FYI-DON'T PUT ANYTHING EXPENSIVE IN YOUR CHECKED BAGGAGE - yes, it seems obvious but we did and unfortunately, by the time we made it back to texas, we realized our camcorder was stolen. the airline has been really nice working with us, but it still stinks.Biggest perks about royal suites compared to other parts of the grand palladium: no kids, guaranteed direct access to the beach/pool and view of the pool, free internet and premium liquor, access to royal gourmet restaurant...overall, generally less crowded with a more mature group of people staying thereBiggest negatives (compared to other parts of the Palladium): the location. most of the a la cartes and the theatres are in the bavaro section...all the way on the other side of the complex. though you could walk it, it might take a good 30 min or more to get over there. there is a tram that stops by the rooms, but it's often full and even then, it takes a long time to get to where you want to go. ______________________________________For those who want more specifics.....Beaches: Fabulous! Probably some of the best we've ever visited. Weather was great and the water was really clear. Yes, you have to play the 'towel game' and reserve a spot at the pool or the beach, but we never had a problem with this. There was always some place on the beach open (and there aren't really any bad spots) or at the pool. Food: we thought it was really good, but we also had realistic expectations. it's similar to what you would find on a cruise. We thought there were plenty of options, and for the most part, we could always find something we liked to eat. We ate at the Royal gourmet, japenese, spanish, and seafood places. They only one we would not give a positive review was the seafood. the service was lacking and slow, not enough menus, the food was way over salted, etc. Plus, even though the lobster was considered 'all-inclusive' at the royal gourmet, it was $33 here. Rooms: We were in the royal jr suite and felt it suited us perfectly. i don't have any complaints. The minifridge was restocked every day, the rooms cleaned every day, we were on the first floor with a balcony facing the pool, we had a jacuzzi tub, a sitting area, nice tv, safe, etc. Activities: we chose to mostly sit on the beach...beautiful and quiet. we went to the shows every night, and though often very cheesy (uh - can we say michael jackson show)...we were really entertained. we went to the spa one day. that was great and the staff was very professional. we went parasailing...way overpriced. wouldn't do it again. we paid $30 to take a boat taxi around the ship wreck, we thought that was pretty cool. we went deep sea fishing with mike's marina. though it was fun, turned out to just be an expensive boat ride because we didn't catch anything. One thing to note....the place shuts down pretty much around 11 unless you want to go to the disco (which was lacking).Tipping: couldn't quite figure this out. we tried to throw down a couple of bucks when we could (like at the restaurants, bars, and spa). It seemed like the only people that expected it were the people we were doing the 'activities' with (e.g. the parasailing and deep sea fishing).Hope this was helpful!", "Date": "May 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR656911927", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mo1279"}, {"Content": "Nothing \"Royal\" about it After reading many positive reviews for the Royal Suites, we were very excited to book our 7 night vacation. We were not impressed! The beaches in Punta Cana are about the best you will find! That is about the only positive I can say about this trip.This Grand Palladium complex is enormous, and is geared for a european crowd. At the gift shop/supermarket you cannot find a single publication in English. Not a newspaper, not a magazine! I would say there was approximately 95% German travelers. No more than 2% were english speaking. The food is, at best, mediocre. The one meal that was excellent was the grilled lobster Sunday evening in the Royal Gourmet. We also tried the Asian and Mexican. We did not enjoy either. Buffets were not very good either. Both variety and selection were lacking. The Royal Junior Suite we had was really nothing special. Room was kept acceptably clean. We tipped the maid several times throughout the week. Nothing special was noticed, not even a simple towel animal The bed was terrible, and the pillows worse! We had to ask three times over the course of a day for extra pillows before any were brought to the room. Furniture was old and in need of replacement. Mini-bar was serviced only after requesting at the front desk. It was then stocked with warm beverages. We had to then travel back to the lobby to find cold beverages, which we did for most of the week as the mini bar rarely had anything in it! We thought the way the toilet and shower were laid out was very odd. They were simply like two closets with glass swinging doors on them, with open space on top and bottom. The toilet provided little privacy. The pool area was very nice, but the pool was always in need of a cleaning, and was also in some disrepair. Wood foot bridges over the pool were in need of paint.Loungers were nearly impossible to be had in either the pool or beach areas unless you played the 'towel game'. Even then, we had loungers taken on two occasions when we had towels on them. We heard about a fight on the beach over this. Ridiculous!! We also found some of the loungers to be broken.We found the service to be hit or miss. Mostly miss! Along with the pillow and mini-bar issues mentioned earlier, restaurant service was no better. Table set-ups were many times missing silverware. Asking for coffee several times, being repeatedly told it was on the way, and then never getting it. Having to go to the bar to get your own drinks during dinner because your waiter never comes back to check on you. I could go on.Punta Cana has become an extremely popular vacation destination. The amount of people traveling there has increased greatly in the last few years. The Punta Cana Airport is already undersized, and very inefficient. Lines were incredibly long and disorganized, with no one to offer direction. Out of six or eight security stations available, two were open. They just haven't figured out how to deal with large crowds. I just can't understand how so many reviewers can say this is a great resort. Were we just there on a bad week? I don't think so.We have traveled extensively in the Riviera Maya of Mexico, as well as several other Caribbean destinations. There are much better resorts to be found.But, as they say-To each his own.This was our third trip to the DR. Once to Puerta Plata, twice to Punta Cana.

In general I would say simply: when you take the same target another or more times, you know how to have your enjoyment there.In our case the answer to many times question is very easy, because we`ve been and seen to some other resorts also in Punta Cana Playa Bavaro area.1) Grand Palladium Resort is large enough for 1-2 weeks vacations (4 hotels, about 12 restaurants, lots of bars), works well and is a well-maintained nature beach paradise. 2) Royal Suites Turquesa is just for us: - peaceful relaxation, - good food and drinks, - spacious beautiful seaview rooms with jazucci in/outdoor, - own pool with swim-up bar (thanks to Danny, Santo) - personal contact with the kind personnel- good service with nice humor3) We especially liked the Royal Gourmet Restaurant, which was new to us. Thanks to Juan, Ana, and many others for taking care of our needs.4) Royal Suites Turquesa recepcion and lobby is a nice place for spending your leisure time with newpapers, internet access and good drinks. Thanks to Edward, Daniela, waiters and all others for good services. 5) Newly opened Renova Spa is just in front of Royal Suites. 6) One of the best things in my mind is that the hotel management is all the time doing a good job to keep the wheels rolling.7) Finally, as I have heard the resort is continuously developing for our next trip, and so we have started to plan our next trip to Royal Suites.Have a good vacation wherever you travel, but be aware where you are going to!Frequent travelers from FInland Europe", "Date": "Apr 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR885761571", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "kukkoka"}, {"Content": "Royal Suites - der absolute Kracher !!!       weiser sandstarnd des hotels", "Date": "Dec 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR477352333", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "arthur24"}, {"Content": "Excellent   showReview(22212717, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR907205102", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "vacdereves"}, {"Content": "insuperable   showReview(21946587, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR202010085", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "loapuntas"}, {"Content": "10 Tage im Paradies   showReview(20531633, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR695770665", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "petersbest"}, {"Content": "Nos defraud\u8d38   showReview(20396762, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR427879285", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "NOA9"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g147293-d1005302-r22698004-The_Royal_Suites_Turquesa_by_Palladium-Punta_Cana_Dominican_Republic.html", "HotelID": "1005302", "Price": "$338"}}
